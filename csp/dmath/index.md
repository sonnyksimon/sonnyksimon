# Discrete Matematics

A **variable** is a number which we don't know yet.

A **universal statement** says that a certain property is true for all elements in a set.

A **conditional statement** says that if once thing is true then some other thing also has to be true.

Given a property that may or may not be true, an **existential sattement** says that there is atleast on King
for mhich the property is ture.

A **universal conditional statement** is a statement that is universal and conditional.

E.g. For all real numbers x, if x is nonzero then x^2 is positive. If a real number 
is nonzero, then its square is positive. For all nonzero numbers x, x^2 . If x is a nonzero
real number, then x^2 is positive. The square of any nonzero real number is positive.
All nonzero real numbers have positive squares.
