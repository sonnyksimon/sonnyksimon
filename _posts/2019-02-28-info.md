Another post after nearly half a decade::

Information is stored a bit weird, especially in computers.

There are apps which are made up of stuff and every stuff has some memory and info.

Memory is things like where(ip?) and when(unix_timestamp?) data was created (not really, just moving bits around).

Pieces of information make up the core of stuff.

Each piece of information also persists for a while (sometimes also for an instant) in memory.

It’s pretty weird see: [here’s a sketch instead](/db.png).
