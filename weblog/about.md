title: What is going on here?

I want to use this as my thinking space, a place to stick any ideas or cool things I'm learning as I go. 

The idea's not mine: both the site's structure and the idea are from [this post](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/about).

*Treat the site as you would a book, that's why there's no comments.*
