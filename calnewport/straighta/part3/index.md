**P**aper writing is hard, and, to some extent, this is
unavoidable. A college-level paper requires you to
sift through endless sources of information, identify
insights, form arguments, and then translate the
results of these efforts into clean, eloquent prose. In
short, a good paper requires a good amount of
serious thinking, and that takes time.

Furthermore, this thinking can’t all be reduced to a
simple system. In high school, you probably had a
nice neat format that all papers could fit into—an
introduction, which stated a thesis, followed by
isolated supporting paragraphs, each providing one
piece of evidence, and then finally a conclusion that
reiterated the thesis. Those were the days!
Unfortunately, this oversimplified system won’t work
in college. The thinking required for a college-level
paper is much more complex. A format that works
for an Anthropology essay, for example, might be
completely different from a format that works for a
History research paper. A piece-by-piece
presentation of evidence might be appropriate for
one class, but multiple intertwined narratives might
be better for another. Each assignment is a fresh
challenge, and each demands a lot of attention and
care.

However, there is hope. Paper writing is hard, but
the good news is that it doesn’t have to be as hard
as most students make it. Let’s begin by taking a
closer look at the paper-writing process itself, which
can be broken down into three separate
components:

1. Sifting through existing arguments.

2. Forming your own argument.

3. Communicating your argument clearly.

Most students approach paper writing by combining
all three of these components into one drawn-out
and bloated process. They sit down at their
computer, stack up some sources, and then begin
writing with only a vague idea of where they’re
headed. Whenever their argument stalls, they flip
through their sources until they find an interesting
quote, they insert this quote into their document, and
then let their argument continue in this new direction
for a while, until it stalls once again—at which point,
it’s back to the sources. This cycle of
research/think/write continues slowly for hours as the
paper is constructed, one painful paragraph at a
time. As you can imagine, this process is incredibly
draining. Each of the three components described
above is mentally taxing, but to do all three *at the
same time* is downright exhausting!

The straight-A approach, on the other hand, is to
separate these components into distinct challenges,
each of which can be handled by a fine-tuned and
efficient system. Each of the three components
remains difficult, but by separating them and
applying systematic strategies to each, no part of the
paper writing process comes even close to the
agonizing approach employed by most students. As
Gretchen, a straight-A student from Skidmore,
emphasizes: “The key to effective paper writing is
breaking down the task into manageable units.”

The straight-A strategy is made up of eight steps.
We start by discussing how to find a topic that will
hold your interest and how to locate a thesis within
the topic that is both interesting and supportable.
From there, we move on to the research effort. This
step is crucial, as research, perhaps more than any
other part of the paper-writing process, is where the
most time can be wasted. We present a streamlined
system for gathering and annotating the right
material as quickly as possible. After research
comes argument construction. There is,
unfortunately, no simple system that guarantees a
smart argument. But we do describe helpful
strategies for gathering feedback on your argument
and recording it in an outline format that best
facilitates the steps that follow.

Next comes the writing. At this point, you have
already figured out exactly what you are going to say
and how you are going to support it, so this step has
been reduced to constructing clear prose for a wellunderstood
argument. As a result, we don’t spend
much time here. **The sooner you dispel the
notion that writing is the most important part of
paper writing, the easier it will become for you
to reap the benefits of the straight-A approach.**
Anna, a straight-A student from Dartmouth, sums this
up succinctly when she notes: “Once I have the
structure, the paper writes itself.”

Finally, we tackle editing. Some students spend
too little time on this step and subsequently hand in
papers with stupid grade-busting mistakes. Other
students spend way too much time on this step, and
thus make the paper-writing process much longer
than it need be. To alleviate these problems, we
conclude Part Three with a specific three-pass
process that will consistently transform your paper
into something worthy of submission—without
wasted effort.

Don’t be intimidated by the number of steps—
many of them describe very short (and quite
painless) procedures, such as finding a topic or
asking your professor for his opinion of your thesis.
We separate these small pieces into their own
steps, however, because it allows us to focus on
their importance and gives you a plan for completing
them—even if their time demands are minimal.

One last note: Not all papers are made equal.
Writing assignments can vary from a three-page
analysis of a book chapter to a fifty-page minidissertation
based on exhaustive research. In
recognition of this variation, we distinguish two
different types of writing assignments: *research
papers* and *critical analysis essays*. The steps that
follow will discuss both of these types separately to
ensure that your paper-writing process is as efficient
and targeted as possible for each specific
assignment.

**Research Papers vs. Critical Analysis Essays**

Writing assignments come in many varieties. Some
require a lot of original research, whereas others
require only a critical discussion of a topic
introduced in class. Some have ulcer-inducing length
requirements, whereas others ask for only a handful
of pages. We capture these differences with the
simple classification scheme of *research papers*
versus *critical analysis essays*. Some assignments,
of course, may fall outside of these two descriptions,
but, for the most part, they capture the major
variations in paper writing. All of the advice that
follows explicitly describes which of these two types
it applies to.

**Research Papers**

A research paper requires you to choose a topic
within provided parameters and then devise an
original thesis relevant to your chosen topic. For
example, the broad parameters for your topic choice
might be “*anything involving the British Empire,*”
the specific topic you choose from within these
parameters might be “*public schools and the British
Empire,*” and the thesis you choose might be “*the
public school system in nineteenth-century
England had a curriculum specifically tailored to
the requirements of the British Empire.*”

Research papers require original research to
support your original thesis, and, accordingly, their
page lengths are long and their due dates are
generally a ways off from when they are assigned. If
you spread out the work appropriately and choose
the right topic, research papers can provide a
rewarding intellectual challenge. Proposing and
supporting an original argument is exciting.
However, if left until the last minute, these
assignments can become a nightmare. More than a
few students have suffered a nervous breakdown
from the stress of tackling a major research paper at
the last moment. So for these assignments in
particular, take careful note of the scheduling
recommendations that follow.

**Critical Analysis Essays**

Critical analysis essays are the bread and butter of
most liberal arts classes. These essays are short,
and they typically require you to analyze one or more
of your class reading assignments. They are often
set up as a comparison, for example: “*How do
Nordlinger and Hopkins differ in their approach to
understanding American Isolationism. What
cultural and theological sources account for these
differences?*”

Critical analysis essays differ from research
papers in several significant ways: Topics are
provided in advance, your thesis is nothing more
than a specific answer to the question asked in the
assignment, and there is little-to-no original research
required. Not surprisingly, these essays require less
time to complete than research papers. Their goal is
to test your understanding of the material presented
in class, not to seek out and present new ideas.

Don’t get the wrong idea—these essays are not
necessarily *easier* than research papers. College
writing assignments follow a simple rule: **The
required precision of your thinking works in
direct proportion to the constraint of the
material**. That is, the more specific the assignment,
the more subtle and detailed your thinking must be.
So beware. If your assignment covers only one
chapter, then you’re going to need to understand
every word of that chapter and be able to articulate
your analysis with precision.

### Step 1 - Target a Titillating Topic

Remember: A topic does not equal a thesis. A topic
describes an interesting subject or area of
observation. A thesis presents an interesting,
specific argument about that subject or observation.
Let’s look at some examples:

***

***

***

| Topic | Thesis |
| - | - |
|There are interesting similarities between the art of Caspar David Friedrich and Washington Allston, even though they on different continents. (*observation*) | These similarities derive from Friedrich and Allston’s shared connection to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and his prescient worked brand of early postmodern philosophy. |
| The early work of Faulkner (*subject*) | Faulkner’s early style was influenced by the European modernists. |
| During the first half of the twentieth century, New York’s Chinatown boomed while other immigrant communities struggled to find a financial foothold. (*observation*) | The cultural institutions of mainland China, when exported to American immigrant populations, provided a support system and organizational structure well suited to mitigate the specific challenges of building financial security in a new country. |

***

As mentioned, for a critical analysis essay, the topic
is provided, so this step won’t be applicable. For a
research paper, however, you get to choose the
topic—so we’ll focus on the specific case of
research paper topic selection for the remainder of
this section.

**Choosing a Research Paper Topic**

Typically, the professor will provide some loose
parameters. For an art history course, these might
be: “Any artist covered in the class so far.” For a
political science class they might be: “Economic
policy and Latin America.” The key is to choose a
topic, within the constraints of the assignment, that
excites you. All work that follows on your paper will
stem from this topic; if you are not intrigued by the
idea, then the paper-writing process will be tedious.
If, on the other hand, you are fascinated, or at least
curious, then the process will be that much easier.

The best way to identify a titillating topic is to start
looking for one early. “I work on topic ideas in my
head and on scraps of paper beginning anywhere
from a week to a month in advance of the actual
deadline for a paper,” explains Doris, a straight-A
Harvard student. Follow this approach. On the very
first day of class, read the description of the
research paper(s) that will be assigned. The syllabus
should describe each paper’s topic parameters, and
the professor will usually discuss these assignments
briefly early on in the term. Once you know the
parameters for the paper, you should constantly be
on the lookout for a particular subject or observation
that interests you. If one reading assignment really
grabs your attention, jot down the topic so you’ll
remember it later. If a professor poses an interesting
question during class, or piques your curiosity by
describing a compelling open area of research,
make a note of it. As Sean, a straight-A student from
Yale, explains: “Keep an eye out for concepts that
interest you in the readings and lectures. If there’s
something that grabs you, it will probably make a
good topic.”

If you have trouble finding a topic in advance, you
have two options. First, as Chien Wen, a straight-A
student from Dartmouth, advises: “Approach your
professor with some ideas you have and let him
recommend some appropriate readings.”
Professors knows their field well, so they should
have no trouble pointing you toward some resources
to help flesh out your initial thoughts. Second, as
Chien Wen also advises: “Read your primary
sources carefully.” Grab a textbook or similar
general source from the class, and then skim through
and look for angles that catch your attention,
passages that make you ask “why,” or descriptions
of competing arguments debating an interesting
subject. “Be imaginative and intuitive—look for
unusual connections between individuals, ideas, and
broader themes,” says Chien Wen.

In general, the more care you take during this first
step, the easier the rest of the paper-writing process
will be, so take your topic choice seriously.

### Step 2 - Conduct a Thesis-Hunting Expedition

Now that you’ve found a topic that excites you, you
need to construct a thesis that makes a compelling
argument concerning this topic. Once again, for a
critical analysis essay, most of the work toward
constructing your thesis has already been done for
you. Typically, the essay prompt will contain a
specific question (i.e., “*How do the two arguments
differ?*” or “*Why does the author say this?*”), and
your thesis is a summary of your answer. For a
research paper, on the other hand, you might be
dealing with a very broad topic that requires
significant digging to find an interesting and
supportable idea that can be expanded to fit the
required page limit.

In both cases, some initial research is required. A
thesis devised from scratch is dangerous. Without
some initial exploration, you have no idea whether or
not your idea is viable, and there are few
experiences worse than being forced to restart a
paper after many hours of work. At the same time,
however, you don’t want to dedicate days to
intensively reading every book in the field in search
of a perfect thesis, because this would be inefficient.

For a critical analysis essay, the solution is
simple: Review both the reading notes and lecture
notes that relate to the essay prompt. And that’s it!
This should provide a rough idea of how you are
going to answer the question posed by the
assignment. Therefore, your thesis has been found.
Even though it’s simple, don’t skip this step for
critical analysis essays. The earlier you develop an
idea of what you are going to say, the more time you
have to refine the nuances of your argument.

For research papers, on the other hand, the task
of finding a thesis is more complicated. No sources
have been preselected for you, and no specific
question has been provided. All you have is a
general topic that you thought up yourself. Now you
must wade into a vast sea of knowledge and
somehow find enough material to devise a strong
thesis—while avoiding drowning in the sheer volume
of available information.

Not surprisingly, the straight-A students
interviewed for this book have mastered the art of
conducting research paper thesis-hunting
expeditions. Their goals are twofold: (1) find an
interesting thesis that can be supported within the
scope of the assignment; and (2) minimize the time
required to conduct this search. Accomplishing both
of these goals sounds hard, but straight-A students
get it done. What’s their secret? One simple phrase:
*Start general, then move one layer deep*. Let’s take
a closer look at what this really means.

**Start General, Then Move One Layer Deep**

“I usually begin with basic sources,” explains Chris, a
straight-A student from Dartmouth. “If I’m doing a
paper on the Kurds in Turkey, for example, I get a
recently published general history on this topic.”
Similarly, if your topic is Faulkner’s early writing, you
might find one or two Faulkner biographies and then
focus only on the chapters dealing with his early
years. If you have a hard time finding a few general
sources for your topic, then ask your professor—he’ll
have plenty of titles to recommend. In addition, keep
in mind that most courses set up a reserve shelf at
the campus library. This shelf contains books that
were selected by the professor because of their
relevance to the course. Typically, you can check out
reserve books for only a couple of hours at a time,
so they should always be available to the students
who need them. This is a great place to find general
sources.

So that’s step one (the “start general” part of the
strategy). The reason we need a second step is
because you shouldn’t expect to find your thesis idea
in a general source. Of course, you might get lucky
and find an interesting thesis during this first step. In
general, however, overview sources will be much too
broad to reveal a targeted and interesting argument
that hasn’t already been written about extensively.

The main reason you found these general sources
is to get at their bibliographies. As Chris goes on to
explain: “I read any chapters from my general
sources that look useful for my paper. I then look up
the sources used in that chapter.” In other words, the
second step of your thesis-hunting expedition is to
examine the list of books and articles cited in the
relevant sections of your general sources. From this
list, choose the cited works that look the most
promising, and then go find them in the library.
These sources will be more focused—perhaps
journal articles or books addressing only a small
number of specific arguments. You are most likely to
come across an interesting and appropriately
targeted thesis idea using these more focused
sources.

Let’s apply this approach to our Faulkner example
from before. Perhaps one of our general sources
cites a journal article on the influence of a specific
European modernist writer on Faulkner. You find this
journal article, and while reviewing it you notice that it
mentions, in passing, a list of other modernist writers
who might have had a similar influence. Aha! Now
this could be an interesting thesis. You might choose
one of these modernists from the list and then look
for historical evidence of their connection to the
primary writer.

Perhaps, instead, one of the general sources talks
about a period of Faulkner’s life that he spent in
Europe. Maybe it also mentions that our only records
of this travel are letters written by the young author
himself, and then it provides a citation to a collection
of these letters. You then locate these letters, begin
to read through them, and notice that he mentions a
particular bar in London several times. This too
might be a source of a fascinating thesis. You could
investigate the intellectual climate of London
nightspots of the time and posit their potential
influence on Faulkner’s work. From there, perhaps
the core of your paper could be to present a piece of
writing from right before the trip, and another from
right after, and then argue which stylistic changes
may have been influenced by his foray into the
intellectual intensity of the London literary milieu. The
key is to keep in mind that even very small
observations can lead to large, interesting
discussions.

How do you know your thesis idea is good enough
to support an insightful paper? “A great thesis
typically has at least these four qualities,” explains
Christine, a straight-A student from Harvard. “It’s
provocative, nuanced, direct, and inclusive.” She
goes on to warn: “A thesis should, at the same time,
also show a grasp of the complexities of a subject
—‘in this poem, X symbolizes Y because Z’ is a
weak type of thesis structure, far too reductive and
simplistic—don’t be afraid to leave room for
ambiguity and unresolved issues.” Wendy, a
straight-A student from Amherst, puts it simply: “The
most important part of your paper is the thesis. Once
you have a solid thesis, the rest just falls into place.”

Here’s the tricky part: Your thesis will change and
evolve as you continue the paper-writing process.
This is inevitable, because you haven’t done your
exhaustive research yet. At this early stage, your
thesis more likely explains the *type* of connection or
answer you hope to find, rather than the final
connections and answers themselves. To revisit our
Faulkner example, your early research may indicate
that the social milieu of a certain London nightspot
influenced a young Faulkner, but you might not yet
know all the ways this influence was manifest. More
research is required, and that’s okay. You should
embrace this evolution of your ideas as the process
continues. For now, it’s sufficient that your fledgling
thesis looks like it’s on the path toward fulfilling the
properties mentioned above. In other words, before
continuing, make sure that your preliminary research
strongly indicates that something similar to your
thesis idea will be supported by the more detailed
investigations to follow. Be honest with yourself: If
you made up your thesis simply because it sounded
cool, but have no real reason to believe it to be true,
then you’re courting a paper-writing disaster. If, on
the other hand, several pieces of early evidence
point to the types of interesting connections
described by your thesis, then you’re on the right
track.

### Step 3 - Seek a Second Opinion

At this point you should have an interesting topic and
a targeted thesis. You’re well on your way toward a
standout paper, but don’t get too far ahead of
yourself. It’s time to take a step back.

More than a few students have dived deep into the
paper-writing process, supported by what they
thought was a compelling thesis, only to find out
many pages later that their premise was not as
strong as it initially seemed. Perhaps they fail to find
enough evidence to support the argument. Perhaps
they stumble across another source that has already
made the exact same point. Or, as is often the case,
perhaps they find their thesis to be too broad to be
succinctly argued within the scope of a paper
assignment.

The thesis-hunting tips of the last step help
eliminate this possibility, but they’re not enough by
themselves. Once you think you have a good thesis,
a final step remains before diving fully into the
research and writing process. As Rielle, a straight-A
student from Brown, explains: “I often talk to a
professor to clarify my ideas before I begin writing.”
This is great advice. For every research paper and
significant critical analysis essay (i.e., assignments
more than just a few pages long), you should make a
habit of discussing your targeted thesis idea with
your professor. Go to office hours, or make an
appointment, explain your topic and thesis, then ask
the following questions:

1. Is my idea appropriate for the assignment?

2. Does it cover too much?

3. Is it too simple?

For a critical analysis essay, if the professor deems
your thesis appropriate, this is a good sign that you
are not going to get stuck. You can now move ahead
with confidence. For a research paper, if the
professor deems your thesis appropriate, take
advantage of this time to explain some of the
sources you plan to examine. The professor will
likely have some additional sources to suggest.
Write these down. This just saved you some serious
research time! For both types of papers, if the
professor isn’t enthusiastic about your thesis idea,
then he or she will likely help you adjust it into
something that is reasonable.

When you leave this meeting, which should require
only ten to twenty minutes, you will have confidence
in the foundation of your paper. You can now move
full speed into the research stage without fear of
reaching a devastating dead end later on in the
process. It’s amazing how many students ignore this
incredible resource. One simple meeting can make
the difference between a standout work and an
incoherent dud.

Remember, this step is not intended as a shortcut.
If you skipped the previous step and show up at
office hours without a targeted idea, the professor is
not going to give you one for free. However, as
Christine from Harvard explains: “They’ll rarely refuse
to listen if they see you’ve thought things out in
advance.”

### Step 4 - Research like a Machine

Not surprisingly, research is the domain of the
research paper. For a critical analysis essay, your
sources are already specified, and there are
probably only one or two of them. Therefore, when
working on an essay, you can skip this step and
move on to Step #5 (Craft a Powerful Story), which
describes how to organize your argument.

For research papers, however, the following
advice is crucial. Why? Because how you research
can make or break your paper-writing efforts. If your
strategy is haphazard—as is the case with most
students—then two immediate problems will arise.
First, the writing process will become frustrating and
tedious, since you will be forced to continually stop
and seek out new sources to extend your argument.
Second, and more important, the resulting paper will
be weak. A good argument requires a solid grasp of
all relevant information. You want all the necessary
facts and ideas to be at your fingertips, easily
manipulated, sourced, and shuffled, as you build
your case. If your sources are incomplete and
disorganized, then your paper will be, too.

On the other hand, you can also run the risk of
spending too much time on research. Many eager
students have succumbed to the horrors of *research
recursion syndrome*—an unhealthy need to go find
“just one more source,” often leading to hours and
hours of wasted time, dorm rooms overwhelmed with
teetering stacks of books, and one seriously sleepdeprived
student. This is grind territory, and you
should avoid it at all costs. So while at first glance it
may seem easier than choosing a thesis or writing
the paper itself, in fact the research step of paper
writing is easy to get wrong.

Fortunately, straight-A students have figured out a
way to walk the research tightrope—getting the
information they need without becoming lost amid
the endless available sources. Their strategy can be
summarized by a simple phrase: **Research like a
machine**. They follow a system—a mechanical
process, the same for every paper—that produces
consistent high-quality results. Feed them a thesis,
watch their wheels turn, and then out pops a set of
photocopied, organized, and annotated notes. Their
system ensures that the quality of their research is
sufficient to fuel a standout paper and at the same
time requires the minimum amount of time to
achieve this goal.

Sounds pretty cool, right? But how does it work?
Their system is based on these four steps:

1. Find sources.

2. Make personal copies of all sources.

3. Annotate the material.

4. Decide if you’re done. (If the answer is “no,”
then loop back to #1.)

That’s it. The devil, of course, is in the details. So
let’s take a closer look at what each of the steps
entails.

**1. Find Sources**

There are two types of sources: general and
specific. As described in Step #2, the former include
overviews of your topic (i.e., biography or textbook),
whereas the latter focus on specific arguments (i.e.,
a journal article or book about a specific event or
idea). For a college-level paper, most of your best
information is going to come from specific sources.
The hard part, of course, is finding them.

There are two strategies that can help you
accomplish this goal. The first is stolen straight from
Step #2: Start with general sources and then look in
their bibliographies for more targeted resources. As
David, a straight-A student from Dartmouth, says:
“Once you have two or three materials that you like,
it’s all about the bibliographies…find out where the
author found the fuel for his arguments and go check
those out.” In Step #2, I suggested that you ask your
professor or browse the course reserve shelf to find
some of these general sources. Another place to
look is your library’s online card catalog. This sounds
obvious, but using an online catalog correctly is not a
trivial task. Just typing in keywords might not turn up
every book that deals with your topic of interest. You
need some more advanced tricks.

One such trick is to take advantage of the Library
of Congress (LOC) topic classifications. What are
these? The Library of Congress tries to classify all
books into one large hierarchy of topics. For
example, Heinrich Harrer’s fascinating book The
White Spider (an account of the first team to ascend
the infamous North Face of the Eiger Mountain) is
described by the following two classifications:

1. Mountaineering—Switzerland—Eiger—
History

2. Eiger (Switzerland)—Description and travel

When you find a book in an online card catalog, its
corresponding LOC topic classifications should be
listed. The cool part is that these topics should also
be hyperlinked. That is, if you found an entry for The
White Spider, you could click on Mountaineering—
Switzerland—Eiger—History to return a list of every
book in the library under this classification.
Therefore, if you find one general source on a topic,
then you can easily find many others. And once you
have found general sources, you can turn to their
bibliographies to find something more specific.

The second strategy for finding specific sources is
to search for them directly. This approach is
important. Not every specific source relevant to your
thesis can be found in the bibliography of a general
source. This is particularly true for more recent
scholarship. Books take a long time to write; if a
paper was published only within the last few years, it
is probably too soon to find a general tome that cites
it.

The problem here is that specific sources can be
difficult to find. For example, continuing with the
Eiger topic introduced above, let’s say your thesis
within this topic is: “The many failed attempts to
ascend the North Face of the Eiger played an
important role in the development of Swiss cultural
identity during the first half of the twentieth century.”
Finding a general source about the Eiger, such as
*The White Spider*, is easy enough. But finding a
targeted source on the impact of the Eiger on Swiss
cultural identity will be significantly more
complicated. Simply typing “the impact of the Eiger
on Swiss cultural identity” into the library card
catalog probably won’t turn up many hits. So how do
you locate these elusive specific sources? There are
four main search tactics.

> **Search Tactic #1: Break Up Your Query into General Chunks**

If you can reduce your specific query to a group of
related, yet succinct, general searches, you will have
a much better chance of finding a relevant source.
Following the Eiger example, you might try:

* Alpine hiking Switzerland culture

* Switzerland cultural identity

* Alpine hiking

* Mountaineering Switzerland

Any o ne of these more general queries could turn up
a source that either directly references your thesis or
makes a point that supports your thesis. With
practice, you will get better at constructing these
general probes aimed at illuminating a specific idea.

> **Search Tactic #2: Use Journal Databases**

As mentioned, specific sources are more likely to
be scholarly articles than books. Your library card
catalog does not index articles.

Therefore, as Chris from Dartmouth recommends,
you should consider “article database searches (like
JSTOR) on the specific topic.”

How do you find these databases? Your library
Web site should contain a list of available electronic
resources. At some point during your freshman year,
you will probably be given an orientation on this
topic. (Even if you sleep through it, as most of us do,
it shouldn’t be that hard to figure out.) This list of
resources is usually broken up by academic
concentration (i.e., Political Science, Anthropology,
and so forth). Go to the concentration relevant to your
paper, and you should see a list of searchable
archives. Many of these resources will be databases
of scholarly articles, so search these focused
databases using the general search term chunks
described in the preceding tactic and see what pops
up.

If your topic is interdisciplinary, meaning that it
draws from multiple academic concentrations, follow
Chris’s advice and try a big database like JSTOR
(http://www.jstor.org), which contains scholarly
articles on a large variety of academic topics.

> **Search Tactic #3: When in Doubt, Google**

“Google is your friend, first and foremost,” says
David from Dartmouth. This is good advice—as
Google is a great tool—but it should be used with
some caution. A good rule of thumb is: **Don’t cite
Web sites.** Academics don’t trust them. Journal
articles go through extensive peer-reviewing before
they are published, and academic books are written
by experts and rigorously edited. On Web sites,
however, anything goes. Therefore, they’re worthless
in terms of supporting an argument. Referencing
Web sites is something you do in high school. If you
do this in college, be prepared to experience the
wrath of your professor.

This being said, Google is still immensely useful.
Not for finding Web sites to cite, but for finding Web
sites that reference books and articles relevant to
your thesis. For example, a search for “Eiger and
Swiss Cultural Identity” might actually turn up some
Web sites dealing with, or related to, this obscure
issue. The Google search algorithm is a lot smarter
than the one used by card catalogs, so even very
complicated queries can turn up surprisingly
accurate results. If you’re lucky, some of these Web
sites will mention specific sources—a book name or
article title. Now you can look up *these* in your card
catalog, and then treat them like any other formal
source.

> **Search Tactic #4: Ask a Librarian**

Most college libraries are staffed with reference
librarians who want nothing more than to help you
find the information that you seek. It’s what they’re
paid to do, and they’re great at it. Too many
students, however, ignore this wonderful resource.
Here you have experts who can save you hours of
struggle by conducting advanced searches on your
behalf; yet most students never think to take
advantage of the opportunity.

Making a visit to the reference desk should be one
of your first steps when researching a challenging
assignment. Simply explain your topic and thesis to
the librarian, and he or she will walk you through
several searches. Not only will this identify some
specific sources that you may have otherwise
missed, but it will also expose you to new library
resources and databases that you can now use for
future projects. The more time you spend with
reference librarians, the better you will become at
finding solid material on your own.

**2. Make Personal Copies of All Sources**

How you handle the sources makes a big difference
in the overall efficiency of the paper-writing process.
Though there are many ways to deal with the book
chapters and articles relevant to your research
efforts, many of the straight-A students interviewed
for this book favored the following strategy: **Make a
photocopy or printout of all relevant material.** If
you find a book that has two chapters related to your
topic, photocopy those two chapters. If you find an
important journal article, photocopy the entire article.
If you find an article online, or a relevant Web site,
print it out. The goal is to create your own personal
hard copy of all sources.

The advantages of this approach are numerous.
First, these hard copies are portable. It’s easier to
carry around a stack of photocopies than a stack of
books and journals, so you can take your research
with you to your secret study spots or office hours.
Second, the information is more accessible. No
flipping through big tomes or searching your
computer hard drive; all the relevant information is
stored in one condensed stack. You can now
physically organize your sources, for example, by
putting them into piles by author, clustering relevant
arguments together with paper clips, or dividing
them into folders labeled by subject. As Sean, a
straight-A student from Yale, explains: “It’s often
easier to grasp something when you have a hard
copy in front of you.” Third, you can mark them up
with impunity. “Printouts and Xeroxes of source info
are often superior to books or digital copies,”
explains Christine from Harvard, “since you can
annotate them to death.” Feel free to underline
things, highlight, draw arrows, cross out sections, or
put big stars next to important points.

In general, this approach maximizes the control
you have over your information, ensuring that your
sources work for you. However, there are a couple of
important caveats to remember. First, make sure
you label each photocopy with all of the information
needed to later construct a formal citation. For
example, if you photocopy a book chapter, jot down
on the first page the name of the book, the author(s),
the publisher and its location, and the copyright date.
Or, if you prefer, follow Christine’s advice and simply
“make a photocopy of the title and copyright info” as
found in the front of the book, so you can use it later
while constructing the works cited for your paper and
ensure that you don’t find yourself “running back to
the library at the last moment for citation info.”

Second, photocopy each source’s bibliography.
This way, if you come across an interesting
reference in one of your photocopies, you will have
easy access to the full citation attached to the
reference. For articles, the bibliography is almost
always listed immediately following the article. For
books using the endnote format, you might have to
flip to the back to find the bibliography for a specific
chapter.

**3. Annotate the Material**

Finding a source, of course, is just the first step. A
stack of photocopied pages is worthless if you don’t
know what information it contains and how it might
be useful to your paper. You need to review the
sources and annotate them with a concise
description of the important information, if any, that
they contain.

Be careful how you proceed here. Your first
instinct might be to follow the advice described in
Part Two about how to take notes on your reading
assignments. Don’t do this—it’s overkill. For now,
you should be content to follow the advice of David
from Dartmouth, who recommends that you “skim,
skim, skim.” Specifically, read through the source
quickly. Every time you pass by an important
definition, idea, or opinion that seems relevant to
your thesis, jot down (on your computer or by hand)
the page number and a quick description. For
example, if the author argues a particular point of
interest, write only what this point is—there is no
need to also copy down the evidence he uses to
support it as you would for notes on a reading
assignment. If the source is a book, then, as Anna
from Dartmouth explains: “Pick out only the chapters
that relate to the specific aspect of the topic that you
are interested in…it is not necessary to read the
entire book!” When you’re finished, staple your
annotations to your personal copy of the
corresponding source.

In general, proper source annotations should act
as concise pointers, containing just enough
information to show you where the relevant
arguments are hiding. In the next step, where you
organize all of your gathered information into a
coherent structure, these simple annotations turn out
to be exactly what you need to quickly assess the
importance of each source. Therefore, you will end
up needing to carefully read only the passages that
help your paper. You should not think of this step as
adding work. As you will soon discover, these
concise annotations are actually going to save you a
significant amount of time.

**4. Decide If You’re Done**

There is no simple answer to this question. While it
would be nice to offer a perfect formula for how much
research is enough, it is impossible—there are just
too many variations to contend with. Some short
papers might require dozens of sources, while some
long tracts may focus entirely on a handful of original
documents.

What follows is a *rough* procedure that should aid
your decision about whether or not you have
gathered enough research. Remember, this is just
an approximation. Always keep in mind the context
of your specific assignment. However, this approach
should help reduce the guesswork involved in
completing this step.

> **The Research Termination Determination Procedure:**

1. List the topics (specific questions, facts, or
accounts from your research) that are crucial to
support your thesis.

2. List the topics that might help you support
your thesis.

3. If you have at least two good sources for each
of the topics from #1, and have at least one
good source for a majority of the topics from #2,
then you’re done. Otherwise, you need to keep
researching.

The reason these criteria are just an approximation
is because at this early stage you probably don’t
know exactly how your thesis argument will proceed,
so you don’t know exactly what information you need.
This procedure simply helps you estimate as best
you can. By separating out the crucial from the
potentially helpful, you are less likely to get stuck
hunting down an obscure piece of information that
you could do without. This approach is advised by
David from Dartmouth, who describes the following
similar procedure for sorting his research sources: “I
make three piles of my sources: very useful,
potentially useful, and not useful.” To draw from our
previous example, if your thesis deals with the Eiger
and Swiss cultural identity, you might construct your
list of “crucial” and “might help” topics as follows:

**1. Topics that are crucial to support the thesis:**

* Basic historical information concerning the
Eiger (when it was discovered, when it was first
climbed, and so forth)

* Arguments concerning Swiss cultural identity
at the turn of the century

**2. Topics that might be helpful in supporting the thesis:**

* Memoirs of people who were involved in the
first ascents of the mountain

* Press accounts from the time (both Swiss and
non-Swiss)

* General discussions of the role of sports and
national pride

If you have a hard time tracking down one of the
topics from the second list, you would still be okay. If,
on the other hand, you have a hard time tracking
down either of the topics from the first list, then you
need to keep looking.

In the next step, where you actually begin to outline
your paper, it’s expected that you might need to
return briefly to the research phase and find
additional sources to fill in any holes. If you follow the
procedure above, however, you will minimize the
amount of secondary research that you are forced to
conduct—thus saving yourself from more hours in the
library.

### Step 5 - Craft a Powerful Story

This step is where the magic happens. It’s the fun
part of paper writing—the moment of intellectual
eureka. You have already defined (and verified) a
compelling thesis, and you have at your disposal a
collection of well-organized and annotated research
material. Now it’s time to stretch your mental
muscles and pull these pieces together into a
powerful story. As Anna from Dartmouth says: “In
order to write a great paper, you really need to make
connections that other people haven’t made, and the
only way to do that is to think.” This is the step where
such thinking occurs.

**Formulate Your Argument**

“You *must* have a vision of what the overall structure
of your paper will be,” explains Frank, a straight-A
student from Brown. “Organization of thought can
make a decently researched essay into a fine piece
of academic work.” Formulating a solid argument,
however, cannot be reduced to a system; it is a
mental exercise that requires critical thinking and
creativity. At the college level, there is no set
structure that allows you to fill in the blanks and
automatically produce a smart paper. As mentioned
in the opening to Part Three, the
intro/body/conclusion nonsense introduced in high
school won’t do you any good here. It’s too
simplistic, and your professors will be expecting
more.

In general, a good college-level argument should
accomplish the following:

1. Draw from previous work on the same topic
to define the context for the discussion.

2. Introduce a thesis and carefully spell out how
it relates to existing work on similar issues.

3. Support the thesis with careful reasoning and
references to existing arguments, evidence, and
primary sources.

4. Introduce some final prognostications about
extending the argument and its potential impact
on the field as a whole.

There is, however, no set order or format for
presenting these general points. One paper might
start by defining the context and then move on to the
thesis. Another paper might start with the thesis,
argue it, and then introduce the broader context at
the end. Many papers might interweave all four
points. There is no right answer here. And the hard
truth is that the only way to get better at organizing
and presenting your thoughts is through practice. So
write a lot and read good arguments a lot. This is the
best recipe for developing your skills for this step.

That being said, there are some *general* pointers
about how to go about formulating your argument.
These aren’t rules for what to say; rather, they are
tips for how to get your brain fired up and your
creative juices flowing.

> **Tip #1:** When it comes time to craft the storyline
> of your paper, put yourself in the right mind-set.
> Grab a copy of *Atlantic Monthly, The New
> Yorker, Harper’s*, or any other publication that
> features well-crafted discussions. Peruse some
> articles, and then go for a walk along a quiet
> path. Alternatively, as David from Dartmouth
> recommends: “Talk to friends—if they are good
> friends they will allow you to bounce ideas off of
> them and talk through your work.” You can also
> cloister yourself in a dusty, wooden-shelved,
> overstuffed-armchair-filled corner of the library,
> or argue with your professor during office hours.
> Reread related articles and chapters from your
> course syllabus. Watch a PBS documentary. Do
> whatever it takes to get the reasoning portions
> of your mind inspired and curious.
> 
> **Tip #2:** At this point, grab your source material
> from the previous step. If your assignment is a
> critical analysis essay, this will consist of only a
> couple of books and your reading notes. If it’s a
> research paper, you might have a large stack of
> photocopied chapters and articles. In either
> case, dive into this information, and start letting
> the relevant facts and arguments settle into your
> mind. This is where your annotations will point
> you toward what’s interesting, and help you
> avoid the irrelevant.
> 
> **Tip #3:** Take a break. Do something else. Let

> increase your understanding. You need to
> expose yourself to the source material again
> and again to fully internalize it. Only then can you
> really pull together the best possible argument.

**Constructing an Outline**

You need an outline to capture the argument you just
spent so much time devising. Keep in mind,
however, that all outlines are not created equal. In
fact, there are two major outline-related mistakes
made by students. First: *under-outlining*. If your
outline lacks enough detail, it’s not going to serve its
purpose as a structure to guide your writing, and you
will end up writing from scratch. You want to avoid
this at all costs; it leads to argumentative dead ends
and weak structure overall. “In high school, I wrote all
my papers in one go, starting with the intro,
constructing and polishing each sentence in order,”
explains Christine from Harvard. “In college I’ve
become a huge fan of outline-based writing, which
has made my essays much more tightly argued and
given them better, clearer trajectories…since I can
now shuffle topics around until they flow with some
natural order and logic—rather than straining
rhetorically to bridge from one idea to another.”

The second mistake: *over-outlining*. Some
students construct beautifully intricate outlines,
replete with three or four levels of information, roman
numerals, digits, letters, and tabs flying everywhere
—the type of outline they taught you to make for your
fifth-grade research project. Don’t do this either. It
constrains you. As Doris from Harvard explains:
“One pitfall to avoid is getting stuck in the outline
stage—I’ve seen students who spend far too much
time embellishing their outlines when they should
really have begun writing the paper itself long ago.”
When it comes time to write, you will be hampered if
you constructed an outline that practically spells out
what each sentence of each paragraph should say.
These sorts of low-level decisions should be made
when you write, not before. It’s not until you’re
actually putting words on paper that you will
understand the best way to make each small piece
of your argument flow. Don’t let an outline make
these decisions for you.

The happy medium between these two extremes
is to construct a topic-level outline. Before we can
cover the specifics of this process, I must first define
what I mean by “topic.” Here, I use the term to
describe any self-contained point that you might
discuss in your paper. Typically, this is something
more general than a piece of evidence but also
more specific than a multipart argument. For
example, here are some sample topics for our
hypothetical paper about the Eiger:

* Our thesis about the Eiger and Swiss cultural
identity

* Early written accounts of the Eiger

* The first ascent of the Eiger

* Contemporary press accounts of Eiger
summit attempts

* Mentions of the Eiger in early-twentieth-century
popular culture

* Mentions of the Eiger in early-twentieth-century
Swiss tourist brochures

* MacMillan’s thesis about the Alps and
European identity

* The relationship between our thesis and
MacMillan’s argument

* Concluding thoughts about our thesis—
implications and future work

We start the outlining process by constructing a topic
skeleton. This is a list of all the topics you will
discuss in your paper, presented in the order that
you plan to include them. Type this list directly into
your computer because you will later need the ability
to insert text in between items.

Your topic skeleton succinctly describes the
structure of your argument. For example, we might
take the previously mentioned topics and order them
as follows to form a topic skeleton for our
hypothetical Eiger paper:

1. Mentions of the Eiger in early-twentiethcentury
Swiss tourist brochures

2. MacMillan’s thesis about the Alps and
European identity

3. Our thesis about the Eiger and Swiss cultural
identity

4. Early written accounts of the Eiger

5. The first ascent of the Eiger

6. Contemporary press accounts of Eiger
summit attempts

7. Mentions of the Eiger in early-twentiethcentury
popular culture

8. The relationship between our thesis and
MacMillan’s argument

9. Concluding thoughts about our thesis—
implications and future work

At this point, no specific pieces of evidence are
described by our outline, but it does capture how the
paper will flow. In a perfect world, you would have at
least one or two good sources to support each topic.
However, it will often occur that as you formulate your
topic skeleton, you come across a topic that you
really need to include but for which you don’t yet have
any sources. That’s okay. We mentioned at the end
of the last step that once you start formulating your
argument, you might come across some holes that
need to be filled. This is exactly where these holes
will become noticeable. Once you have completed
your topic skeleton, you need to return to the
previous step and find sources to support any of the
currently unsupported topics. If you followed the
research termination determination procedure from
before, there shouldn’t be too many of these holes.

> **Filling in the Details of Your Topic Outline**

Once you finish your topic skeleton, and find
sources for all of the unsupported topics, it’s time to
fill in the supporting details. This next step is crucial.
As Christine from Harvard explains: “Below each
bold header [in my topic skeleton], I compile in
regular typeface the evidence pertaining to that
header.” You should actually type quotes from your
research material right into the word processor
document containing the outline, and label each
quote with the source and page that it came from.
For example, under the “first ascent of the Eiger”
topic from above, you might insert quotes from a few
different books on the mountain as well as excerpts
from several contemporary articles. Some of these
latter excerpts may also be included under the
“contemporary press accounts of Eiger summit
attempts” topic. It’s okay to share information
between topics at this point, since you will sort out
which quote to use where once the writing process
begins. This is not a time for caution—if it seems
relevant, stick it in.

At first, this step may sound excessive. By the
time you finish, your outline will be large and filled
with quotes, perhaps even longer than the projected
length of your completed paper. Fortunately, this
process is greatly simplified by the format of your
gathered research materials. Because you made a
personal copy of and annotated every source,
finding the appropriate pieces of evidence to include
in your outline will be much easier than if you had to
page through each book and article from scratch.
Furthermore, the benefits of this outline far outweigh
the annoyance of constructing it. As Robert, a
straight-A student from Brown, explains; “I find that
using this process helps me avoid digging through a
pile of books and articles for each piece of
information I need as I need it during writing.”

Remember, the goal of the straight-A approach is
to separate the different components of paper
construction. When it comes time to write, you don’t
want to be flipping through your sources, hunting
down the right support. This drains your energy,
increases your pain, takes time, and reduces the
quality of your writing. This is why it is crucial that you
extract the information from your sources in advance.
Later, the writing process will be reduced to the
much simpler task of simply building a framework
around this already identified and organized
information structure.

### Step 6 - Consult Your Expert Panel

“I discuss ideas with friends,” says Suzanne, a
straight-A student from Brown, “and am therefore
usually pretty confident with my argument by the time
I sit down to write.” Suzanne reinforces a key
observation: The more input you receive, the better
your paper will turn out. And because soliciting
advice is easy, you might as well get your outline
reviewed by a group of people you trust. In the
straight-A lexicon, this strategy is called “consulting
your expert panel.” The technique is popular
because it requires little effort on your part, but the
impact on your paper quality is significant. This is the
final push that transforms your thinking from
interesting into compelling and your paper from
competent into a standout.

**Choosing Your Expert Panel**

The size of your expert panel should be directly
proportional to the importance of the assignment. If
it’s a one-page essay worth 5 percent of your grade,
then your expert panel should consist of only yourself.
If it’s a medium-size critical analysis essay, you
might aim for two opinions. If it’s a major term paper
worth a significant portion of your grade, than you
may want to solicit feedback from as many as half-adozen
well-chosen people.

Who should sit on your panel? Your number one
pick should be your professor. Unless he specifically
states that he won’t discuss drafts in progress (which
professors sometimes do to avoid an overload of
conferencing in a large class), definitely plan to bring
your outline to office hours. Lay out the general
shape of your argument, and the types of sources
you are drawing from and where. More often than
not, the professor will have some targeted advice on
how to better present your points. He might suggest
a new order or an added topic that should be
addressed. As David from Dartmouth notes, this
meeting also “will help you to create a rapport with
the prof, and give you an idea of what he or she is
looking for.”

Yes, you’ve already talked with your professor in
Step #3 (Seek a Second Opinion). Don’t worry.
There is nothing wrong with talking to a professor on
two separate occasions for one paper. The first
conference was quick and dealt with making sure
you were starting off in the right direction. This
second conference is more detailed, making sure
that you managed to stay on course. Keep in mind
that some students talk to their professors many
times during the paper-writing process, perhaps
once or twice a week. This is overkill and shouldn’t
be necessary if you’ve followed the efficient strategy
laid out in this book. But rest assured that two visits
are hardly monopolizing your professor’s time.

In addition to your professor, as David also
suggests, “if you have smart friends, get their help
too.” Friends from the same class are your best bet,
since they will already understand the constraints of
the assignment. If you aren’t close with any
classmates, then tap a friend with a compatible
academic background. For example, if your paper is
for a history class, it makes more sense to talk to a
liberal arts major than an engineering major. The
former will be more familiar with this style of paper.

Pick a half-hour period to sit down with each friend
you chose. Explain your thesis and then run through
your outline, touching on your main supporting
arguments. Your friends will help you identify pieces
of your structure that are unclear or unnecessary. As
Jason, a straight-A student from the University of
Pennsylvania, explains: “If you can explain why your
argument works in a rational, step-by-step manner,
and you have an arsenal of sources to cite to support
the argument, then you’re ready to go.”

One final warning: Before discussing with a
classmate, make sure that collaboration of this sort
is allowed. It should be no problem for research
papers, but for focused critical analysis essays the
professor may specifically forbid that you discuss
your response with other people from the class.

### Step 7 - Write Without the Agony

If you’ve followed the Straight-A strategy so far,
writing should be the most straightforward part of
constructing a standout paper. This step is not
mysterious. At this point, you know what to say and
in what order, so all you have to do is clearly
communicate your already well-developed argument.
“Once I have the outline, my brain relaxes,” explains
Jeremy, a straight-A student from Dartmouth. “I don’t
need to think anymore about structuring the paper,
but rather just think about how to best articulate my
thoughts.”

Note, however, that this book is not about the
mechanics of writing. This is a skill that you will need
to develop on your own. In general, the more you
write outside of class, the better; so, to improve your
skills, try to write as much as you can. Also, don’t be
afraid to plunk a *Chicago Manual of Style* above
your desk or flip through well-known style guides like
William Zinsser’s *On Writing Well*. These can help
you focus and polish your writing, and professors
appreciate clear exposition.

This being said, there is not much left to cover.
You know what you have to do: Put words on paper.
It’s not easy, but, if you followed the previous steps, it
won’t be nearly as agonizing as most students make
it. I leave you with only three succinct pieces of
logistical advice to help guide you through the
process of combining your writing skills with your
straight-A preparation to produce the best possible
paper:

**Separate Your Writing from the Steps That Come Before and After**

As Greta, a straight-A student from Dartmouth,
explains, when it comes to the writing process she
“would map out a schedule, for example, write two
pages a day for five days, and then edit one day.”
Ryan, another Dartmouth student, admits that he
“usually gave about two days for the actual writing,
but the research part of the paper usually happened
a few weeks before.” Both of these students’ habits
are instructed by a simple rule: Separate your
research from your writing and your writing from your
editing.

Of course, this is not always practical for a small
critical analysis essay, but it’s crucial for a more
substantial research paper. A fresh mind produces
better results. It’s hard to write well when you’ve
spent an exhausting morning researching in the
library. It’s equally as hard to edit carefully when you
have already spent hours that day writing the words
you are about to review. “Having time away from the
paper,” explains Jeremy from Dartmouth, “allows you
to come at it with better concentration.”

**Write in Quiet Isolation**

Writing requires substantial concentration. If you
work in an area with a lot of ambient noise, you will
become distracted and your efficiency will decrease
dramatically. Therefore, if you have a laptop, retreat
to a distant, silent corner of a faraway building to
work on your writing. “I am most productive,” explains
Suzanne from Brown, “in a place where I have total
silence and no external stimulation—for example, the
library stacks.” As I emphasized in Part One of this
book, avoid, if possible, study lounges, crowded
areas of the library, and public computer labs. These
places are noisy, and, as Rielle from Brown warns:
“You’re always running into people and getting
snagged by fascinating conversations.” If you don’t
have a laptop, then work at the computer in your
room at times when your roommates are in class or
at meetings. If necessary, arrange in advance to kick
them out for a few hours so you can work in peace. In
addition, you should schedule your writing to
correspond to your energetic high points during the
day. For me, this meant working right after breakfast
with my first cup of coffee. For others, this might be
the early evening, right before dinner, or the
afternoon after a post-lunch workout. **The key is to
recognize that writing is perhaps the most
demanding (in terms of focus required)
intellectual activity you will do while a college
student.** More so than reading, solving problem
sets, or studying, writing demands all the energy and
focus that you can manage.

**Follow Your Outline and Move Slowly**

Chris from Dartmouth offers simple advice for
tackling the writing process: “I use the outline I’ve
created as a guide and just sort of build from that,
taking it one paragraph at a time.” Follow this
example. Use your outline to direct your writing,
setting up and expounding on each of the topics in a
clear, cogent way, and copying and pasting quotes
directly into your paper wherever needed. Keep your
attention focused on the topic at hand. Your mind is
free from concerns of structure and sources at this
point, so you can concentrate on articulating specific
points clearly and strongly.

Always make sure your current point reads clearly
before moving on to the next. Some students have
success by writing their first draft quickly and
sloppily, and then returning to clean it up in many
successive editing rounds. In your case, however,
because you’re working from a detailed topic
outline, it will end up being quicker to write carefully
the first time. Moving fast tends to produce timeconsuming
dead ends later on, and ultimately
necessitates major rewrites.

And, believe it or not, that’s all you need to know.
So stop fearing writing! If you follow this system, this
step, though still challenging, won’t take an
excessive amount of time. Leave the all-nighters to
the average students, get your first draft done quickly
and effectively, and then go have some fun.

### Step 8 - Fix, Don’t Fixate

Editing your paper is important, and this shouldn’t
come as a surprise. If you hand in pages containing
spelling and grammatical mistakes, the professor
will be more than disappointed—she’s likely to lower
your grade as a result. Even if your argument is
brilliant, it’s really hard to get past those simple
errors. This last step of the paper-writing process
aims to free your work of these imperfections.

At the same time, however, you don’t want to
overedit. Many students fixate on these fixes, and
end up devoting hours to reviewing draft after draft.
This act of academic self-flagellation is especially
prevalent when working on big research papers.
After all the work you dedicate to crafting a
masterpiece of an argument, you begin to fear letting
your baby out into the world. It’s sort of like suffering
from a nerdy version of Stockholm Syndrome—and
it’s a drag. “You can edit a paper forever and still not
be satisfied,” explains Frank from Brown. “So it’s
important to know when to just print the damn thing
out and send it off to its fate.”

The goal here is to devise a simple system,
something you can follow for every paper to help you
root out the embarrassing typos and confusing
constructions but also to prevent you from becoming
a grammar psycho. Drawing from the advice given in
my straight-A interviews, I present in this step a
system that meets these criteria. It involves three
simple passes through your draft. No more and no
less. For those of you who are used to endless
editing runs, the idea that three passes is enough
might sound suspiciously quick. Or, if you’re the kind
of person whose idea of proofreading is hitting the
spell-check button, multiple runs might seem
hopelessly time consuming. But rest assured, the
system is efficient and it gets the job done. As we
will soon discuss, the key is the specific kind of
attention given to each pass. Here is how it works:

**The Argument Adjustment Pass**

Your first pass through your work should be
conducted on your computer. Read carefully, and
focus on the presentation of your arguments—don’t
worry about small grammatical mistakes for the
moment. Take in the paper one paragraph at a time.
If a section is awkwardly stated, clarify the
sentences. If it makes a point you already explained
earlier, ruthlessly cut it out. If the argument is lacking
detail, add in more sentences as necessary to fully
explain your point. If a transition is lacking between
topics or paragraphs, add one.

Also be on the lookout for any major structural
issues. Sometimes you don’t realize until you finish
an entire draft that your topic outline wasn’t optimal.
Don’t be afraid to shift around major chunks of text.
This is your chance to make serious edits to the
structure of your paper, so take this seriously. Do
this editing at a time when you are rested and
unhurried by upcoming appointments. For a large
paper, spread this pass out over several days if
possible.

When you’re done, your paper may still contain
small mistakes. That’s okay. You’ll fix those next. The
goal here is to tweak the argument until you’re
satisfied that it makes every point that you want to
make in the order that you want to make them. Once
you’re done with this pass, these big picture details
are locked in.

**The Out Loud Pass**

The Argument Adjustment pass is important, but not
sufficient by itself. As Robert from Brown explains:
“My papers always read differently on the page than
on the screen.” And as Melanie, a straight-A
Dartmouth student, adds: “having a hard copy to
read and mark up was absolutely necessary.”

Accordingly, for this next pass, you should first
print out a copy of your paper, and then take it where
you can have some privacy. With a pencil in hand,
and this is the important part, begin to read your
paper *out loud*. Don’t cheat. Use a strong voice and
articulate each word as if you’re delivering a speech.
For a long paper, it may take a long time to read the
entire thing, so be prepared to split this into several
sessions. You might also want water or hot tea on
hand to prevent you from losing your voice. Whatever
you do, however, don’t avoid actually articulating
every word.

Whereas the last pass focused on your
arguments, the goal of this pass is to root out small
mistakes that might otherwise distract a reader from
your engaging thesis. While reading, whenever you
come across a grammatical mistake or an awkward
construction, mark it clearly on the printout. Then go
back up to the beginning of the preceding paragraph
and start reading again. After you have marked up
the entire document, go back to your computer and
enter the changes you noted on your printout. A word
of warning—this process always takes longer than
expected, so leave yourself plenty of time.

The rationale behind this approach is simple. As
Ryan from Dartmouth explains: “Reading it out loud
helps you catch typos or strange wording better than
reading it in your head.” No matter how many times
you review a draft, if you’re scanning silently, there
are certain awkward phrases you might skip over
every time—our subconscious minds have a habit of
patching over these mistakes when reading our own
writing. When you say the words out loud, on the
other hand, your ear will catch even minor problems
and draw your attention to them. “Something that
looks fine on paper will jump out as strange or poorly
worded when you hear it,” explains Jeremy from
Dartmouth. Therefore, by reading the paper out loud,
you will catch most mistakes in your paper in just one
pass—requiring much less time than the multiple
silent reviews necessary to achieve similar results.

**The Sanity Pass**

Because the previous passes were so careful,
you’re almost done, and you’ve only read through
your work twice so far! Just to be sure that
something embarrassing didn’t slip through, it’s a
good idea to make a final, quick pass through a
printed copy of your paper before handing it in. You
don’t have to do this pass out loud, and feel free to
move through it quickly. But definitely use a printed
copy, rather than reading on your computer screen,
since a hard copy has a better chance of revealing a
typo. If possible, separate this pass from the
previous two. In fact, it’s fine to do this the morning of
the deadline. At this point, there should be no major
mistakes lurking in your document.

The goal here is twofold. First, as mentioned, this
last pass catches stray mistakes. “I tried to always
reread my papers before handing them in,” explains
James, a straight-A student from Dartmouth. “I try to
smooth out any last kinks in the flow during that final
editing.” Second, and perhaps more important, it
also provides closure on your paper. Because your
work is so polished by this point, this final readthrough
should essentially go smoothly. As a result,
you will develop a better feel for the flow and enjoy
the experience of watching your argument unfold.
This should help put your mind at ease. After all your
work, think of this last pass as your reward. A final
review before the paper leaves your hands, probably
never to be read by you again. That’s why we call it a
sanity pass. Once you hand in your paper, you can
now confidently tell yourself: “Unless I’m going insane
here, I’m pretty sure that I just handed in a damn
good piece of writing!”

> ### The Plan in Action

As in Part Two, we end our discussion with a pair of
detailed case studies that show you how to put the
straight-A system into practice. One focuses on a
research paper, whereas the other focuses on a
critical analysis essay. Notice how the students in
the following case studies adapt the system to the
demands of each assignment. And, in both cases,
pay attention to how our system reduces the time
required for writing, the step most students
unfoundedly fear above all others.

**Case Study #1—Mindy’s Art History Research Paper**

Mindy’s class on Early American Art doesn’t have a
final exam. This was, not surprisingly, an important
motivation in her decision to register for this
particular subject. But now, as the end of the term
approaches, Mindy realizes her joy was premature.
In place of the final exam, she must instead write a
truly intimidating research paper—a thirty- to fiftypage
colossus that is worth half of her final grade.
The subject matter is wide open; the paper can
cover any topic regarding any American artist before
the modern period. The professor has made it clear
that he expects a large and well-considered
argument from each student. He warns the class to
start early and work hard. Last-minute efforts will be
easily identified and graded with a punitive abandon.

> **Monday—One Month Before the Due Date**

With a month to go until the deadline, Mindy
decides it’s time to initiate the early stages of the
straight-A process. She has no intention of
beginning serious researching or writing at this point
—it’s too early for that; instead, she’s simply kicking
off the nondemanding “thinking phase” of the paper
process: choosing a topic, finding a thesis idea, and
then getting a second opinion on the idea from her
professor.

For her first step, Mindy spends a half hour
Monday night flipping through her class notes, trying
to find a topic that piques her interest. Without too
much searching, she comes across something
promising. Early in the course, when they were
studying the American expatriate painter
Washington Allston, the professor made a comment
about some similarities between Allston’s paintings
and those of German artist Caspar David Friedrich.
The connection was interesting because, as far as
the professor knew, the two painters had never met.
Mindy had jotted down this comment in her notes
along with a little exclamation point. Perhaps this
mysterious connection would make for a good
topic? Mindy will have to conduct a thesis-hunting
expedition to find out for sure, but it’s a good start.

> **Wednesday—Three Weeks and Five Days to the Due Date**

Mindy has set aside a couple of hours to lurk in the
library and seek out an interesting thesis relating to
her topic idea. She starts with the card catalog, and
soon finds some monographs that focus entirely on
Allston’s career. She is able to locate two of these
books amid the stacks, and then settles into a
nearby study carrel to go through them. For the first
hour, she chooses one of the titles, and begins to
read it. This helps her build a better understanding of
Allston’s background and the significance of his
career. She realizes, however, that it will be too time
consuming for her to continue trying to read the
entire book, so she next flips straight to the index.
She hits pay dirt in the index of one of the two books:
an entry for Caspar David Friedrich. Flipping to that
page, she sees a quick one-sentence note about
how some author (whose name she doesn’t
recognize) has posited a connection between
Allston and Friedrich. Mindy looks up the reference
connected to this sentence and finds the title of an
obscure book about philosophy and the early
Romantic artists. She finds the call number for this
new book, and dives back into the stacks to find it.
*Success!* The old manuscript has a chapter devoted
to Allston and Friedrich. In fact, it goes so far as to
compare two of their paintings and offer an
explanation for the similarities.

Mindy makes a photocopy of this chapter and
labels it with the information she will need to later
cite the book. She leaves the library with her
personal copy of this key source in hand.

> **Friday—Three Weeks and Three Days to the Due Date**

Mindy’s Art History professor has office hours on
Friday afternoons. This is a perfect opportunity for
Mindy to seek a second opinion on her thesis idea.
The problem, however, is that she doesn’t yet have a
fully formed idea. For now, she is stuck with only an
intriguing topic. With this in mind, she sets aside an
hour in the morning to read through her personal
copy of the source she found in the library earlier in
the week. Her hope is to develop some interesting
ideas before office hours that afternoon.

This careful review gives Mindy a better
understanding of the author’s argument. Fortunately,
it’s focused. The author looks at a painting by each
artist, and he then gives a concise and specific
philosophical rationale for both. This focus is
fortunate because it leaves a lot of room for Mindy to
extend the argument—even though she’s not yet
sure what this extension will entail. She recognizes
that making a well-considered but constrained
addition to an already established argument is great
way to develop a meaningful but manageable
research paper thesis.

During lulls in class that day, Mindy continues to
mull over her topic, trying to find a good direction for
her thesis. Finally, as the bell rings, an insight hits
her. The source she found had explained a shared
philosophy between Allston and Friedrich. But it did
nothing to explain why they both followed this
philosophy. If Mindy can find a common source for
the artists’ shared philosophical interests, then that
could make for a fascinating argument!

Arriving at office hours later that afternoon, Mindy
explains her thesis idea to her professor. The
keyword here is “idea.” She does not yet know if this
direction will bear fruit. It’s possible that her research
would turn up no information that helps explain the
shared philosophical interests between the two
artists, so there is, as is often the case with an
engaging thesis idea, an element of risk at this early
stage. By meeting with her professor, however,
Mindy can greatly reduce this risk. That’s a major
reason why this step is so important. A professor
can draw from his deep pool of knowledge and
experience with a topic and generate a reasonable
hunch as to whether or not a specific idea seems
promising—potentially preventing a frustrating dead
end. Fortunately for Mindy, her professor likes the
thesis. To him, it seems likely that Mindy can find
some evidence for a connection, and he points her
toward some well-known Allston and Friedrich
monographs that might help her investigation.

> **Sunday—Three Weeks and One Day to the Due Date**

Mindy makes another journey to the library, armed
with the book suggestions she received from her
professor. Using a well-stocked iPod to abate her
boredom, she seeks out two of these books, one for
each artist, and makes personal copies of the
relevant chapters of each. This takes a good hour to
complete, but the work is mindless, so it’s not that
bad.

Later that evening, Mindy takes these newly
acquired personal copies to one of her favorite
isolated study spots. She begins to skim through
and annotate each. She’s not exactly sure what
she’s looking for, but she knows the more
information she has found, copied, and labeled, the
better off she will be.

Over time she begins to notice a name that keeps
popping up in her Allston book: Samuel Taylor
Coleridge, a young European writer and thinker who
seemed to have a big impact on Allston.

Mindy hopes to find a mention of Coleridge in the
Friedrich material, but she comes up empty-handed.
This doesn’t dissuade her, however; Friedrich, as it
turns out, was hanging around several European
philosophical circles at the time. It would not be
surprising if there were some sort of connection to
Coleridge through one of them.

Her interest piqued, Mindy fires up the library Web
page. In class the professor had shown them a
journal database that allows you to search for journal
articles relating to Art History. Mindy navigates to
this page and begins searching, using queries that
include both Friedrich and Coleridge. After some
sifting through the results, she finds what she is
looking for: an article about Friedrich and a group of
artists he worked with in Germany. In the abstract for
this article, it’s mentioned that Coleridge was among
the philosophers whose work inspired the group.

A connection has been found! Mindy prints the
article and records on the first page all the
information she needs to later cite it.

**Monday to Sunday—Three Weeks to the Due Date**

Excited by her find, Mindy e-mails her professor to
explain her newly developed “Coleridge as the
missing link” thesis. He loves it and gives her some
advice on what sort of additional evidence would
help make the case compelling.

With an approved thesis in hand, and a good idea
of what additional sources she’ll need to form a
strong argument, Mindy can now lay out a rough
schedule for the steps that follow. Over the next week
she will continue to research. Then she will spend the
following week crafting her story, building an outline,
and getting some final feedback on the argument.
This will leave her exactly one week to turn a detailed
topic outline into a few dozen pages of coherent
writing. The schedule is reasonable in that it doesn’t
require work every day, and it rarely requires more
than a couple hours on any given day—thus the
construction of her paper can be easily woven into
her already busy schedule.

Following the straight-A approach, Mindy’s week
of research proceeds mechanically. At each trip to
library, on average, Mindy spends one or two hours,
during which she finds two or three sources. Each
source gets copied, labeled, and annotated. She
makes these trips three times during the week and
once on Sunday, leaving her with a significant stack
of annotated material. Remember, at this point very
little thinking has been dedicated to how all of these
pieces will fit together into the final paper. That’s for
the next step.

> **Monday to Sunday—Two Weeks to the Due Date**

Now comes the fun part. In one hand, Mindy has a
compelling thesis. In the other hand, she has a stack
of annotated personal copies of sources relating to
the thesis. Now she has to figure out how to combine
the two into a believable story.

There is no mechanical solution to this problem; it
requires some serious thinking. And this is exactly
what Mindy does. Over the course of this week she
takes a lot of walks around campus to consider her
argument. She imagines explaining her thesis to an
enthralled audience. She revisits her source material
often to refresh her memory on what information is
available and to stoke the flames of her intellectual
curiosity. On a couple of occasions, she even
shoehorns her poor roommates into listening to her
talk through the current state of her paper idea. By
the time Friday rolls around, she has a pretty good
idea of how she will present this story. She will start
with explaining the philosophical connection
between Allston and Friedrich’s work (as outlined in
that original source she found during her thesishunting
expedition), explain how this philosophy
matches Coleridge’s philosophy, and then provide a
compelling connection between Coleridge and each
of the two artists.

That afternoon, Mindy organizes the personal
copies of her sources into three piles, one for each
of these three major pieces of her story. She also
attends office hours once again. This time she is
able to explain to her professor the specifics of her
argument and provide examples of the sources she
is using to support the argument. He still seems
excited about the thesis, and provides some good
advice on how to make the argument slightly
stronger.

Armed with this knowledge, Mindy spends the
weekend constructing her topic-level outline. This
takes time, since she has to copy many quotes from
her sources and into her outline document. However,
she basically did no hard work during the preceding
week, other than thinking about her argument
whenever she had a free moment, so a little effort
over the weekend is not an unreasonable demand.

By Sunday afternoon, Mindy has constructed a
thoughtful outline, full of quotes from her sources.
She has already discussed her argument with her
professor, but before she begins to write, she wants
some more opinions. That afternoon, she sets up
meetings with two of her classmates to discuss their
paper ideas. During both meetings, Mindy is
surprised by how little work has been accomplished
by her peers—most of them are just starting their
search for a thesis—but she does get good
feedback on her own argument. Mindy integrates
this feedback into her outline, and can now go to
sleep confident that the structure of her paper is
solid.

> **Monday to Sunday—*Last Week
Before Due Date***

Mindy’s plan is to write a little bit each day of the
week, with the goal of using the weekend only to
edit. Writing, however, takes time. And Mindy’s
week is busy. Not surprisingly, she doesn’t quite
meet her goal of finishing an entire rough draft by
Friday, but she comes close (when you have a
detailed topic-level outline, writing moves much
quicker than when you have to continually search
through your sources).

That said, this weekend will definitely be a busy
one if Mindy is going to get this paper finished and
edited in time. Understanding the urgency of the
looming deadline, Mindy goes into crisis writing
mode on Saturday. Starting early in the morning,
Mindy holes herself up in a quiet medical library at
the outskirts of campus. Armed with energy-boosting
snacks and a thermos of coffee, she writes
continually, taking short breaks every fifty minutes,
until her rough draft is complete. At forty pages long,
the paper is both considerable and well thought out.

Nevertheless, Mindy is worried about leaving *all* of
the editing until the day before, so after a relaxing
dinner she begins her Argument Adjustment Pass on
her computer screen. She’s tired from a long day of
writing, so she makes it through only about a third of
the paper before she throws in the towel and goes
out to have some fun with her friends for the rest of
the night. Getting that little piece of editing done,
however, will make her task tomorrow easier to
handle.

Sunday morning, Mindy picks up where she left
off. By lunchtime she has finished the Argument
Adjustment Pass, and now things are starting to look
good. After lunch, she hits the gym for an hour to
revive her energy and spends some time with a
friend to relax and let her mind recharge. Later that
afternoon, she brings a printout of her paper to her
dorm room and begins her Out Loud Pass. After a
break for dinner, she continues this slow but
necessary process. By 9 P.M. she finishes the pass.
By 10:30 P.M. she has finished integrating the
marked changes into her paper. Time for sleep.

> **Monday—The Due Date**

Monday morning, Mindy blocks out one and a half
hours to conduct her Sanity Pass. Reading through a
printout of the paper rather quickly, she notices a
couple of little fixes. More important, however, her
confidence in the paper builds. After all the hard
work, she is proud of her argument. It’s well
considered, well supported, and well written. She is
excited for her professor to read this.

When class time finally rolls around, Mindy hands
in her paper with a smile on her face. She is secretly
amused to notice the bleary-eyed stagger with which
many of her classmates enter the classroom. For
many, this paper came together in a one-week
frenzied marathon of simultaneous research and
writing. Mindy’s work is going to shine compared to
these last-minute efforts.

> **The Result**

No surprises here. Mindy’s work is a standout.
She receives an “A+” and a page full of glowing
comments from her professor.

What’s important is that Mindy did not spend any
more time actually *writing* than her classmates. In
fact, her time at the keyboard was probably less than
most of her peers because when Mindy sat down in
front of the computer, she already knew exactly what
to say. Also important, Mindy avoided any painfully
long work pushes. Outside of a semi-late night on
the day before the due date, and a long day of
writing two days before the due date, Mindy avoided
ever putting in more than a handful of hours on any
given day. Constructing a standout “A” paper hardly
interfered with her schedule at all. That’s what’s so
amazing with the straight-A strategy. It improves your
grade *and* makes the process seem less time
consuming.

**Case Study #2—Chris’s Film Studies Critical Analysis Essay**

After the intense, monthlong effort described in the
previous case study, we now move to the opposite
end of the paper-writing spectrum. Here we focus on
the (comparatively) simple process of writing a short
critical analysis essay. Specifically, we consider
Chris, whose Film Studies course features a weekly
essay assignment. Every Monday, his class watches
a film and then is assigned several readings on its
merits. The class is then responsible for writing a
short (two to five pages) critical analysis essay about
the film, describing the student’s opinion and how it
compares and contrasts to those outlined in the
articles read in class that week. The essay is then
due the following Monday.

> **Monday—One Week Before the Due Date**

Because these essays are due every week, Chris
has discovered, through trial and error, a smart
timeline for getting the work done with a minimal
impact on his ever-busy schedule. It works as
follows: Monday is for choosing a couple of reading
assignments from his syllabus to really read
carefully, Tuesday through Thursday is for finishing
these readings, Saturday is for outlining, and Sunday
is for writing and editing.

On Monday, following his timeline, Chris briefly
reviews the syllabus for the week. Usually there are
three or four readings assigned, but Christopher has
learned that it’s usually sufficient to draw from just
two sources in his essay. He likes to choose these
two in advance so he knows where to focus his
attention. After a quick skim of the introductions, he
settles on a pair of readings that seem to come to an
opposite conclusion about the movie: One loves it,
the other hates it. These sorts of stark oppositions
tend to provide a lot of meat for a quick analysis.

> **Tuesday—Six Days Before the Due Date**

Chris completes the first reading. It’s a chapter
from a book and somewhat complicated. He tries to
take careful notes on his laptop using the
question/evidence/conclusion format described in
Part Two. He runs out of time before dinner and
ends up having to return to the library later that
evening to get the reading done. No big deal.

> **Wednesday—Five Days Before the Due Date**

Chris tackles his second reading. This time he
has a good two-hour chunk set aside in the morning,
when his energy is high. His progress is steady, and
he finishes with time to spare.

> **Thursday and Friday—Four to Three Days Before the Due Date**

Chris doesn’t need to think about the essay during
these two days. He has more than enough other
schoolwork to keep him busy on Thursday. And
Friday, as always, is dedicated to burning off a week
of built-up social energy with his friends.

> **Saturday—Two Days Before the Due Date**

During the afternoon, Chris prints out his reading
notes. As is his habit, he rereads the notes in his
dorm and then takes the long route to the library,
thinking about the structure of his essay along the
way. He has already decided that he agrees more
with the reading assignment that liked the movie.
The argument presented in this reading focused
mainly on the technical aspects of the film,
discussing how the mixture of stark lighting and fast
cuts presented a refreshingly modern take on film
noir. Chris agrees with these technical arguments,
but he also remembers liking the dialogue. At the
time, he noted only that it sounded interesting to his
ear, but now, in the light of this particular reading, it
dawns on him that what made the dialogue so
interesting was its mixture of old-style, film-noir
catch-phrases and a fast, slang-rich, modern street
diction. This seems like a cool extension to the
argument from the reading, and Chris decides to
make this the centerpiece of his essay.

Chris arrives at his favorite study carrel, hidden in
a dark corner of the library, pulls out his laptop, and
puts together a rough topic outline. He decides to
follow a classic format. He will start with a brief
summary of the two readings he chose to focus on.
He will briefly acknowledge the negative critiques as
being, for the most part, true, but then contest that
the good qualities of the film outweigh the bad. Here
he will flesh out some more details of the positive
reading, then add his own extension to this argument
by discussing how the dialogue reinforces a similar
combination of old and new. A quick conclusion
calling the movie an important work will cap the
essay nicely. When he’s done, the topic skeleton
reads as follows:

* Summary of pro and con readings

* Acknowledge and dismiss con reading

* More detailed summary of pro reading

* My argument on the dialogue as modernizing force

* Conclusion

His next step is to copy the relevant quotes from
the two assignments into this outline. Because he is
dealing with only two sources, each of which he
reads carefully, this process doesn’t take long.

Finally, even though he has other things to do,
Chris holds out for another half hour to write a rough
draft of his introduction. For whatever reason, he has
found that having some writing done (even if it is only
a paragraph) makes it easier to start the next day.

> **Sunday—One Day Before the Due Date**

After sleeping off the effects of a party the night
before, Chris returns to the library. As is always the
case, Sunday afternoons are for writing, so he
knows exactly what to do. Armed with his topic
outline, and an already written introduction, this
process takes no more than a couple of hours. He
heads to an early dinner with a rough draft of the
essay complete.

Later that night, Chris completes a quick
Argument Adjustment Pass and then prints out a
copy to do his Out Loud Pass. Because the essay is
only a few pages long, these two passes take no
more than an hour. After a TV break, Chris spends
fifteen minutes doing a Sanity Pass. And that’s it.
He’s done. He prints out a final draft and jams it in
his bag so he won’t forget it the next morning.

> **The Result**

Once again, our straight-A student didn’t spend
any more time reading sources and writing than
most of his classmates. But this essay, like his
others, will get an A. Why? Because he separated
the reading from the thinking and the thinking from
the writing. This leads to a well-thought-out
argument, clearly articulated. By finishing his reading
on Wednesday, Chris had two days for the ideas to
float around in the background of his mind. By the
time he began thinking about his outline on
Saturday, this material had been well digested. By
completing a topic-level outline, and then waiting a
night before starting to write, Chris had even more
time to mull (consciously or not) over his argument in
this more polished state. By the time he sat down at
his computer on Sunday, the key pieces of this
essay had been worked and reworked internally over
a long period. This extra attention to the argument
came through in his assignment, and, not
surprisingly, a high grade followed.

### Part Three Cheat Sheet

#### Step #1. Target a Titillating Topic

* Start looking for an interesting topic early.

#### Step #2. Conduct a Thesis-Hunting Expedition
* Start with general sources and then follow
references to find the more targeted sources
where good thesis ideas often hide.

#### Step #3. Seek a Second Opinion
* A thesis is not a thesis until a professor has
approved it.

#### Step #4. Research like a Machine
* Find sources.

* Make personal copies of all sources.

* Annotate the material.

* Decide if you’re done. (If the answer is “no,”
loop back to #1.)

#### Step #5. Craft a Powerful Story
* There is no shortcut to developing a well balanced
and easy-to-follow argument.

* Dedicate a good deal of thought over time to
getting it right.

* Describe your argument in a topic-level
outline.

* Type supporting quotes from sources directly
into your outline.

#### Step #6. Consult Your Expert Panel
* Before starting to write, get some opinions on
the organization of your argument and your
support from classmates and friends who are
familiar with the general area of study.

* The more important the paper, the more
people who should review it.

#### Step #7. Write Without the Agony
* Follow your outline and articulate your points
clearly.

* Write no more than three to five pages per
weekday and five to eight pages per weekend
day.

#### Step #8. Fix, Don’t Fixate
* Solid editing requires only three careful
passes:

  – *The Argument Adjustment Pass*: Read the
  paper carefully on your computer to make sure
  your argument is clear, fix obvious errors, and
  rewrite where the flow needs improvement.

  – *The Out Loud Pass*: Carefully read out loud a
  printed copy of your paper, marking any
  awkward passages or unclear explanations.

  – *The Sanity Pass*: A final pass over a printed
  version of the paper to check the overall flow
  and to root out any remaining errors.
