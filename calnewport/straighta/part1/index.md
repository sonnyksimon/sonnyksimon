**A** common complaint I hear from students is that
they never seem to have enough time to finish all of
their work. They vent about how many hours they
spend—late nights reviewing in the library,
weekends sacrificed to paper writing—but no matter
how hard they try, there always seems to be
something else due. As Matthew, a straight-A
student from Brown, explains, it’s easy for college
students to become “stuck in a state of permanent
catch-up.” Understandably, these students feel like
they have reached their academic limit; they believe
that unless they forgo sleep or any semblance of a
social life, there are simply not enough hours in the
day to stay on top of all their schoolwork.

Let’s start by getting one thing clear: This belief is
false. The problem here is not the amount of
available hours, but rather how each hour is spent. I
know this from firsthand experience. While
researching this book, I spent time with some of the
country’s most accomplished students, and I can
assure you that no matter how diligent you think you
are, there is a Rhodes scholar out there who fits in
three times the amount of work and activities you do
and probably still manages to party harder than you
would ever dare. I don’t mean to imply that everyone
should aim to become a drunken Rhodes scholar
(though it would certainly be fun to try); rather, my
point is that a surprising amount of work, relaxation,
and socializing can be extracted from a single
twelve-hour day. A lack of time, therefore, isn’t
enough to explain why so many students feel
overwhelmed. So what does explain this
phenomenon? The answer, as it turns out, has much
more to do with *how* we work than what we’re trying
to accomplish.

As humans, our minds have evolved to prefer
short-term tasks such as “run away from that lion” or
“eat food.” Therefore, when you walk into the library
on a Sunday morning with the goal of finishing all of
your homework and writing a paper, your brain isn’t
happy. The idea of spending eight consecutive hours
trapped in a study carrel is dispiriting. Plus, it’s hard
to focus for that long, so pretty soon fatigue will set
in, your concentration will wander, and every
distraction will suddenly seem impossibly appealing.
Before you know it, the day will be over and you’ll
realize that you haven’t accomplished much
productive work at all. The next day, new
assignments will pile onto those you didn’t finish on
Sunday, and the tedious process starts all over
again.

Jason, a straight-A student from the University of
Pennsylvania, uses the term “pseudo-working” to
describe this common approach to studying. The
pseudo-worker looks and feels like someone who is
working hard—he or she spends a long time in the
library and is not afraid to push on late into the night
—but, because of a lack of focus and concentration,
doesn’t actually accomplish much. This bad habit is
endemic on most college campuses. For example,
at Dartmouth there was a section of the main library
that was open twenty-four hours a day, and the
students I used to see in there late at night huddled
in groups, gulping coffee and griping about their
hardships, were definitely pseudo-working. The
roommate who flips through her chemistry notes on
the couch while watching TV is pseudo-working. The
guy who brings three meals, a blanket, and six-pack
of Red Bull to the study lounge in preparation for an
all-day paper-writing marathon is also pseudo-
working. By placing themselves in distracting
environments and insisting on working in long
tedious stretches, these students are crippling their
brain’s ability to think clearly and efficiently
accomplish the task at hand. The result is fatigue
headaches and lackluster outcomes.

The bigger problem here is that most students
don’t even realize that they’re pseudo-working. To
them pseudo-work *is* work—it’s how they’ve always
done it, and it’s how all of their friends do it. It never
crosses their mind that there might be a better way.
Straight-A students, on the other hand, know all
about pseudo-work. They fear it, and for good
reason. It not only wastes time, but it’s also mentally
draining. There is just no way to be well-balanced,
happy, and academically successful if you’re
regularly burning through your free hours in long,
painful stretches of inefficient studying. The students
I interviewed for this book emphasized again and
again the importance of avoiding this trap. In fact,
when asked what one skill was most important in
becoming a non-grind straight-A student, most of
them cited the ability to get work done quickly and
with a minimum of wasted effort.

So how do these students achieve this goal? A
big part of the solution is timing—they gain efficiency
by compressing work into focused bursts. To
understand the power of this approach, consider the
following simple formula:

> **work accomplished = time spent x intensity of
> focus**

Pseudo-work features a very low intensity of focus.
Therefore, to accomplish something by pseudo-
working, you need to spend a lot of time. The
straight-A approach, on the other hand, maximizes
intensity in order to minimize time. For example, let’s
rank intensity on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the
most intense). Assume it takes ten hours to finish
studying for a test by pseudo-working with a low
intensity score of 3. According to our formula, this
same amount of work can be accomplished in only
three one-hour bursts, each with an intensity of 10.
The work that took you all day Sunday to complete
could instead be finished by studying an hour after
breakfast, an hour after lunch, and an hour after
dinner—the rest of the day being free for you to
relax!

With this formula in mind, you can begin to
understand why many straight-A students actually
study less than their classmates: They replace long,
low-intensity stretches of work with a small number of
short, high-intensity sessions. Of course, this is not
the whole story behind their success; what straight-A
students actually do in these short bursts is also
crucial— *technique* is just as important as *timing* .
Part Two (Quizzes and Exams) and Part Three
(Essays and Papers) of this book are dedicated to
these technical details. But learning how to follow an
efficient schedule, and banishing pseudo-work from
your college experience for good, is a crucial first
step toward your academic overhaul.

To accomplish this transformation, however, you
will need to gain control over your lifestyle—and
that’s often no small task. For example, you will need
to spread out the intense work sessions so that you
have time in between to recharge. This requires
basic time-management skills. You’re also going to
have to overcome your urge to procrastinate,
because scheduling your work is meaningless if you
don’t actually work in the time you set aside. This
requires self-motivation. Finally, to obtain the highest
possible levels of intensity, you need to choose the
right locations, times of day, and durations to study. If
you aren’t careful about how you select these three
factors, you can unintentionally sabotage your ability
to focus. This requires a smart planning strategy.

Part One will teach you how to satisfy these
requirements. It begins with the presentation of a
simple time-management system, customized for
the busy college lifestyle. Don’t be frightened, the
system is incredibly lightweight—it’s designed to
require only five minutes a day of planning and can
survive periods of neglect. Part One then continues
with a collection of battle-tested strategies to help
you fight procrastination. This advice comes straight
from the experiences of real students and has been
proven to work amid the chaos and distractions of
the typical undergraduate lifestyle—it is simple, easy
to apply, and surprisingly effective. This part
concludes with a discussion of when during the day,
where on campus, and for how long to study to
maximize your productivity. The students interviewed
for this book experimented extensively to find the
right answers to these key questions, and, in this
final step, I pass these answers on to you.

Together, these basic skills are the foundation
upon which all the advice in this book is built. Without
them, you’ll be unable to implement the specific
study techniques described in the parts that follow.
Master them, however, and you will experience
improvements in all aspects of your life—not just
grades. You’ll have more free time, you’ll get the
sleep you crave, you’ll party harder, and you’ll be
able to devote more energy to your extracurricular
interests. So relax. You are about to take your first
step toward a much more enjoyable and productive
college experience.

### Step 1 - Manage Your Time in Five Minutes a Day

Real straight-A students, like most reasonable
students, hate time management. After all, college is
supposed to be about intellectual curiosity, making
new friends, and becoming obsessed with
needlessly complicated drinking games. An
overwhelming interest in time management is best
left to harried business executives (or, perhaps,
premeds). At the same time, however, you can’t
abandon all attempts to keep tabs on your schedule.
As mentioned in the introduction to Part One, all of
the techniques described in this book require some
ability to control your schedule. Ignore this skill, and
you doom yourself to four long years of playing
catch-up with your work. As Doris, a straight-A
student from Harvard, states: “Time management is
critical—it’s a skill that you absolutely must develop
over the course of your time at college.”

Most students, however, misunderstand the
purpose of time management—they believe it’s
used only to cram as much work as possible into the
day. But this is not the main motivation behind
controlling your schedule. As it turns out, a little
planning goes a long way toward reducing your daily
stress levels. Having deadlines and obligations
floating around in your mind is exhausting—it makes
it impossible to completely relax, and, over time, can
lead you down the path toward a breakdown.
However, once you figure out what work needs to be
done and when, it’s like a weight being lifted from
your shoulders. The uncertainty vanishes: When you
work, you can fully concentrate on the assignment in
front of you, and when you relax, you can do so
without any anxiety. “I don’t believe in giving up
anything,” says Jenna, a straight-A student from
Princeton. “Not my social life, not my extracurricular
activities, not my academic success.” Basic control
over your schedule breeds balance. This is why time
management, as Doris stated earlier, is the key to
getting the most out of all aspects of your college
experience.

The goal of Step #1 is to present a time-
management system that helps you achieve this
stress-free balance without requiring you to sacrifice
the spontaneity and excitement of college.

Specifically, we present a system tailored to the
typical undergraduate lifestyle that meets the
following criteria:

1. Requires no more than five to ten minutes of
effort in a single twenty-four-hour period.

2. Doesn’t force an unchangeable minute-by-
minute schedule on your day.

3. Helps you remember, plan, and complete
important tasks before the very last moment.

4. Can be quickly restarted after periods of
neglect.

We will cover the details of this system in a few
simple steps and then conclude with a detailed case
study so you can see how it works in a realistic
setting.

#### What You Need

This system requires two pieces of equipment.

1. **A calendar:** It doesn’t matter what type of
calendar, and it’s not something that you have to
carry around with you. It can be Microsoft
Outlook or iCal on your computer, a cheap day
planner, or one of those advertisement-laden
freebies they hand out at orientation. It just has
to be something that you can reference every
morning that has enough space to record *at
least a dozen items* for each day.

2. **A list:** Some piece of writing material that
you can update throughout the day. This you *do*
have to carry around with you, so make it
something simple, like a sheet of paper ripped
out of a notebook each morning.

#### The Basic Idea

Record all of your to-dos and deadlines on your
calendar. This becomes your master schedule, the
one place that stores everything you need to do. The
key to our system, however, is that you need to deal
with your calendar only once every twenty-four hours.
Each morning, you look at it to figure out what you
should try to finish that day. Then, throughout the day,
whenever you encounter a new to-do or deadline,
simply jot it down on your list. The next morning, you
can transfer this new stuff from your list onto your
calendar, where it’s safe. And we’re back where we
started.

*That’s it*. Pretty simple, right? The whole system
can be summarized in three easy steps: (1) Jot
down new tasks and assignments on your list during
the day; (2) next morning, transfer these new items
from your list onto your calendar; and (3) then take a
couple of minutes to plan your day.

Now, we’ll examine these steps in a little more
detail. In particular, we need some strategies for how
to plan your day each morning using your calendar
and what to do when unexpected events interfere
and turn that plan upside down (trust me, this will
happen more often than not).

#### Update Your Calendar Each Morning

This is where the magic happens. Every morning,
spend a few minutes to update your calendar and
figure out what you should try to accomplish. This is
the only serious time-management thinking you have
to do for the whole day, so the demand is pretty
reasonable. This updating process should proceed
as follows:

Find your list from the day before. It will probably
look something like the example described in Figure 1. 
Don’t worry too much about how this list is
formatted; we will discuss that shortly. For now, focus
on the “things to remember” column, which contains
the new to-dos and deadlines that were jotted down
throughout the day.

---

> **Figure 1. Sample List**
> 
> **Tuesday—1/24/06**
> 
> |**Today's Schedule**|**Things to Remember**|
> |-|-|
> |~~10:00 to 12:00 Econ class~~|Econ study group, Thur. at 9 P.M.|
> |~~12:00 to 1:00 Lunch with Rob~~|French quiz moved to Friday.|
> |~~1:00 to 1:45 Government reading~~|Laundry|
> |~~2:00 to 4:00 Government class~~|Start researching summer internship opportunities|
> |~~4:00 to 5:30 Finish government reading~~||
> |5:30 to 6:30 Start French essay||

---

Transfer these new items onto your calendar.
Write the deadlines on the appropriate dates, and
write the to-dos on the days when you plan to
complete them. Following the example of our sample
list, you would first jot down the econ study group
time under Thursday’s date and the French quiz
under Friday’s date. You would then choose a day to
do laundry and jot down a reminder under that date,
and choose a day to start internship research and jot
down a reminder under this date. You can move
these items around on your calendar as many times
as you want, so don’t worry too much about which
date you initially choose for a new to-do. However,
try to use some common sense. For example, if
Wednesday afternoon and evening are packed with
meetings and work, this might not be the best day to
schedule doing your laundry. Similarly, if you have a
big test Monday morning, don’t schedule a lot of
annoying errands for Sunday; you’ll need your
concentration for studying. If something is not
especially time sensitive, such as the internship
research example from above, don’t be afraid to put
it on a day far in the future, at a point when you know
you will be less busy—such as right after midterms
or at the beginning of a new semester.

Next, move the to-dos that you planned for
yesterday, but didn’t complete, to new days on your
calendar. In our sample list from Figure 1, the
Today’s Schedule column describes to-dos planned
from the day before. As you can see, in this
example, all the to-dos were completed except the
“Start French essay” task, so you would need to
move this task to a new date.

At this point, your calendar once again holds
everything that you need to get done. Now it’s time to
figure out your plan for the current day. Go ahead
and trash yesterday’s list—it’s served its purpose—
and grab a fresh sheet of paper to use as today’s
list. Divide it into two columns, as shown in Figure 1,
and label them *Today’s Schedule* and *Things to
Remember* , respectively.

Next, look at the calendar entry for the current day.
It will probably contain a handful of appointments and
to-dos. Your goal is to figure out how much of this
work you can realistically accomplish. You might be
tempted to simply copy all of these tasks into your
Today’s Schedule column and then treat it as a
simple to-do list for the day. *Don’t do this*! If you want
to avoid getting overwhelmed by your work, you
need to be smarter about your time.

Here is what you should do instead: **Try to label
each of your to-dos for the day with a specific
time period during which you are going to
complete it**. Be honest. Don’t record that you are
going to study for three hours starting at three if you
know that you have a meeting at five. And be
reasonable about how long things really take—don’t
plan to read two hundred pages in one hour. For
simplicity, group many little tasks (errands that take
less than ten minutes) into one big block (for
example: “ 10:00 to 10:45—*mail letter, return library
book, buy new deodorant, fill out transcript request
form at registrar* ”). Leave plenty of time for breaks.
Give yourself an hour for meals, not twenty minutes.
And, if possible, end your day at an appropriate
hour; don’t try to fit in work right up until sleep time
because you need to be able to unwind and relax. In
general—though it may seem counterintuitive—be
pessimistic. The truth is: Things will come up. Don’t
assume that every hour that looks free in the morning
will stay free throughout the day.

Remember, the goal here is not to squeeze
everything into one day at all costs, but rather to find
out how many of the tasks listed for the day you
actually have time to accomplish. If you can’t fit all the
to-dos into your schedule for the day, no problem!
Simply move the remaining items onto the calendar
entries for future dates. You can deal with them later.

Your final step is to record the tasks you will have
time for into the Today’s Schedule column of your
list. As shown in Figure 1, label each task with its
time. That’s it. You can now reference your list
throughout the day to remind yourself of what you
should be doing and when.

But here’s the important point: The specific times
on your schedule aren’t set in stone—they’re more of
a suggestion. As we will discuss shortly, you will be
free to move tasks around throughout the day,
depending on your energy level and unexpected
events that may arise. The main reason you break
down your to-dos into time slots is to help you avoid
the common student mistake of overestimating your
free time. Many well-intentioned students use a
simple to-do list to keep track of their daily
obligations. But without time labeling, they have no
idea how much they can actually accomplish, leading
to an unrealistic plan. A twelve-hour day seems like
a large amount of time, but when you account for
meals and classes and meetings and breaks and
socializing, your schedule suddenly becomes a lot
tighter. The equation is simple: If you overestimate
your free time, then you are likely to put off work until
it’s too late. And this leads to all-nighters, panic
attacks, and shoddy performance. A realistic sense
of time is arguably one of the most important factors
in succeeding as a student. After a week or two of
time labeling your to-dos, you will be well along your
way toward developing this crucial trait.

**Use the List During the Day**

As you move through your day, use the rough
schedule recorded under the Today’s Schedule
column to remind yourself what you should be doing.
Keep in mind that the student lifestyle is, generally,
quite unpredictable. Things will always come up at
the last minute. Work will take longer than expected,
your roommate will point you toward some absurd
Web site that immediately demands an afternoon of
your scrutiny—you know how it goes. So adjust your
time labels as many times as needed. But don’t
procrastinate excessively! The list you constructed in
the morning should contain a reasonable amount of
work, so if your schedule doesn’t become too
unexpectedly crazy, you should be able to
accomplish most, if not all, of these tasks. In general,
if you’re completing most of what’s on your list at
least five days out of seven, then you’re as
productive as any student realistically needs to be. If
not, don’t worry—the next section of Part One will
teach you how to combat your urge to procrastinate.

Remember, your list also serves another important
purpose. During the day you will probably encounter
various *new* to-dos and deadlines that need to be
scheduled. For example, a professor might
announce the date of an upcoming exam, or a friend
might give you the date and time for an upcoming
study group. The key is to get these obligations out
of your head as soon as possible so your mind is not
unnecessarily cluttered. Jot down a quick reminder
on your list, in the Things to Remember column, as
soon as they occur. This takes only a few seconds,
and then you can forget about them. The actual
scheduling of these tasks will take place the next
morning; all you have to do for now is scribble a few
words on a piece of scrap paper.

Remember, to-dos and deadlines that exist only in
your mind drain your energy, distract your attention,
create stress, and are more likely to be forgotten.
When you’re working, you should be able to
concentrate on working, and when you’re relaxing,
you should be able to enjoy relaxing. But you can’t
devote 100 percent of your energy to any activity
when you have important reminders bouncing
around in your head.

Few students have the energy to schedule every
new piece of information that comes along during
the day. Think about this for a moment: If it’s the
middle of the afternoon, and you are hungry, and
everyone is just getting up to leave at the end of a
long class, when suddenly the professor yells out a
notice that a paper topic is due the following week...
you’re probably not going to have the energy to stop
packing up, take out a calendar, think about what
steps are involved in coming up with a paper topic,
and then schedule each step on the appropriate
days. It would be nice if you did, because then you
could purge the deadline from your mind and be
confident that it’s safely recorded in your calendar—
but this is unrealistic. And it violates our original
criterion that any time-management system should
require only a few minutes each day.

That’s the power of the “things to remember”
column of your list. You can’t expect yourself to be
able to think seriously about time management at all
points during your busy day. But the act of pulling out
a piece of scrap paper from your pocket and quickly
jotting down “anthro paper topic” requires minimal
energy, no thinking, and barely any time. You don’t
have to consider when to begin working on the
paper topic, what steps are involved, or how many
days it will require. You simply scribble down three
words.

The key is that the list is a trusted piece of
storage. You are confident that tomorrow morning,
when you’re doing your only time-management
thinking for the day, you will see that reminder and
record the appropriate steps in your calendar.
Because of your list, the deadline will not be lost. It
will be scheduled.

#### Restarting After a Period of Neglect

To date, I have yet to have successfully followed any
time-management system without interruption for
longer than two months. I try, but inevitably I hit a
rough patch. Typically, this happens during the few
days following a really busy period—I’m so
exhausted from the intensity of the preceding work
that I find myself unable to even mention the word “to-
do” without breaking into a cold sweat. This happens
to everyone, and you can expect that periodically it
will happen to you too. Don’t fear these occasions,
and don’t let them make you feel like a failure.
They’re normal.

The key point is that these lapses are temporary.
After a couple days of swearing off my calendar, I
always find myself growing uncomfortable with the
increasing number of obligations that are free
floating in my mind. Before I know it, I’m back into the
swing of using the system again, and no worse for
wear. The same will be true for you. Once you have
learned the power of feeling organized, you will have
a hard time going long periods without it.

Fortunately, the system described here is
adaptable to these periods of neglect. If you skip a
few days, all you need to do upon restarting is to
dump all the to-dos and deadlines free floating in
your mind onto a sheet of paper and then push these
back onto your calendar for future dates.

#### Case Study: A Monday with Stephen

Even the simplest systems can come across as
confusing when first described. So let’s go through a
quick example that will show you how to put this
system into practice. Stephen’s story is based upon
the real-life college experiences of myself and the
many students I interviewed. If you’re already at
college, what follows will seem familiar. If you haven’t
yet started your undergraduate career, don’t panic!
Yes, Stephen has a lot on his plate. Notice, however,
how he uses our system to keep control of his many
obligations. Though he can’t finish everything in one
day, he remains confident that everything that needs
to get done will get done in time. As you read this
example, imagine how Stephen’s stress might
increase, and his efficiency decrease, if he didn’t
have his list and calendar to guide his actions and
capture the new to-dos and deadlines that constantly
pop up.

> **Monday Morning**

Stephen gets up early because he has class at
9:30 A.M .—a horrible thing. He grabs his calendar
from his desk and roots around in his hamper to find
the sheet of notebook paper that he used as
yesterday’s list. He has only a couple of minutes
before class, but that’s okay. Our system requires
very little time.

Figure 2 shows what Stephen finds recorded on
his calendar for today.

---

Figure 3 shows what he finds scrawled on
yesterday’s list.

There are several things to notice here. First,
Stephen has a lot of work recorded on his calendar
entry for today. More than he can probably
accomplish in twelve hours, so some of these to-dos
will need to be moved to other dates. Also notice
Stephen’s schedule from the day before (Sunday).
This is typical. A fun night on Saturday inevitably
leads to a late start and a large workload on Sunday.
Stephen was too ambitious with his planning, and by
10:00 P.M . he was burnt out from working on his
essay and never got around to starting the
Government reading he had scheduled. So this task
will need to be carried over to today. Finally, notice
how Stephen’s Things to Remember column from
yesterday includes some long-term projects, such as
“Create schedule for practicing guitar.” This is a
great use of the list! If you jot down ideas for
extracurricular and personal projects as they occur to
you, they will get moved onto your calendar and
therefore won’t be forgotten until you finally get
around to doing something about them.

Now let’s see how Stephen gets a handle on all of
this before class.

> **What Does Stephen Do First?**

Stephen’s first step is to time label the tasks
currently on his plate so he can determine how much
he can actually get done. Between his calendar entry
for today and the leftovers from yesterday’s list,
Stephen has a *lot* of to-dos to schedule. His strategy
is simple: He starts time labeling in order of
importance until his schedule is full, and then moves
the rest of the items to other days on the calendar.
To effectively time label, however, he must first figure
out how much free time he has available. Stephen
quickly runs through the following in his head:

> *I have class from 9:30 to 10:30 , and another
> class from 11:00 to 12:00 . It’s unlikely that I will
> get any work done between my 7:00 P.M . dinner
> and the Alpha Chi party that starts soon after. I
> should also try to squeeze in an hour or two for
> a predinner workout (have to look good in that
> toga), so I should aim to be done with all of my
> work by **5:00** .*

With his free time now identified, Stephen can begin
to time label his to-dos. Here is his thought process:

> *In between class, from **10:30** to **11:00**, I can
> squeeze in my three small tasks—pay cell
> phone bill, buy a birthday gift for Dad, and
> return Mark’s CD. After my second class, I will
> need to get lunch, but then I should get right to
> work on my Government reading because it’s
> due tomorrow! Let’s see, I have three
> Government articles to read, which will

At this point, Stephen is almost done. All that’s left is
taking care of the still-unscheduled to-dos by moving
them to future dates. Remember, these include both
the unscheduled tasks recorded for the current day
and the “things to remember” items from yesterday’s
list.

> Anthro reading to **tomorrow’s** calendar entry,
> and then move the Government paper

> I hand in my Econ problem set. Done!*

That’s it. Stephen has finished all of his serious time-
management thinking for the day. Before leaving for
class, he rips out a fresh sheet of notebook paper to
use for today’s list. He divides it into two columns
and jots down the tasks he scheduled for the day.
Figure 4 shows what Stephen’s list looks like as he
bolts out the door.

The entire process described above would
realistically take only around three to five minutes to
complete. The more you use this system, the more
natural it becomes. Before you know it, updating
your calendar and dashing off a daily schedule will
become as routine as taking a morning shower.
Remember, this is the only serious time-
management thinking that Stephen has to do all day.
Now he’s ready to face his Monday with his mind
free from worry about tasks he’s forgetting or due
dates that are looming. He knows he has scheduled
all the tasks on his plate and that they will get done
eventually. He has a flexible plan. And he can trust it.

Now let’s see how Stephen holds up...

> **During the Day on Monday**

The day starts off fine. Stephen successfully
finishes the small tasks that he scheduled for **10:30** .
During his second class, he remembers that he has
some overdue library books that need to be
returned. No problem. Stephen whips the list out of
his pocket and jots down “ *Return books* ” under the
“Things to Remember” column. A little later, the
professor announces the date and time of the
midterm—something else that needs to be
scheduled. Again, no problem for Stephen. He adds
“ *Sched. Gov midterm (4/5, 3 P.M .)* ” to his list, and
then leaves the classroom confident that these tasks
will be scheduled appropriately tomorrow morning.

After a leisurely lunch, Stephen hunkers down in
the library to tackle his government reading. The
articles are a little shorter than usual, so he finishes
by **2:30**, which is nice.

As he leaves the library, however, Stephen runs
into a friend who convinces him to tag along on a
Wal-Mart run. To be honest, it didn’t take much
convincing. College students, for some inexplicable
reason, love Wal-Mart runs.

After this (unavoidable) detour, Stephen gets back
to campus by **3:30** . Now he’s behind schedule.
Quickly checking his e-mail, Stephen sees a
message from a classmate asking if he wants to join
a study group at 4:00 to work on the Econ problem
set. Swiftly adapting, Stephen once again whips out
his list and makes a couple of rapid changes to the
Today’s Schedule column. He bumps up the Anthro
paper topic work to start now, and then replaces his
Econ problem set work with the study group that he
just found out about. One of the big advantages of
this system is its flexibility. Schedules will always
change, but this the system makes it easy for you to
regain your focus after getting sidetracked. Figure 5
shows the new state of Stephen’s list.

---

The Anthro work goes fine. Stephen finds a topic
that he is happy with and then runs off to meet with
his Econ group. During the meeting, the group
agrees to meet again Tuesday morning to finish the
problem set. Stephen quickly jots down “ *Econ group
—10 A.M.* ” under Things to Remember and then
heads off to the gym. He’s done with work for the
day.

> **The Aftermath**

Because he finished a lot of work during the
morning and afternoon before the party, Stephen
was able to really relax and have a good time that
night. In addition, he successfully recorded all of the
new to-dos and deadlines that cropped up during the
day. Instead of bouncing around in his head and
causing stress, they were safely placed in Stephen’s
system and will be scheduled in due time. Most
important, none of this required him to explicitly think
about time management beyond the five minutes he
spent planning that morning and the quick
rescheduling he did in the afternoon.

As suggested at the beginning of this case study,
imagine for a moment what Stephen’s day might
have been like without the simple time-management
system. What if, instead, he’d employed the strategy
used by most students and simply tried to remember
what he needed to get done? It’s highly unlikely that
the small tasks—returning a CD, buying a birthday
gift, paying a bill—would have been completed.
Without a schedule, people don’t like to do menial
chores unless they’re 100 percent necessary.
There’s also a good chance that he would have
forgotten about the Anthro paper topic altogether
after the last-minute study group came up.

What about the big-picture reminders from
Sunday—calling home, scheduling internships,
creating a guitar-practicing schedule? Those would
have been pushed out of his head completely by the
demands of near-future deadlines. Without a system
to capture them, we can’t expect Stephen to
remember long-term ideas for any extended period
of time.

Most important, without the system, Stephen
would have completed much less schoolwork on
Monday. The day would have focused, more or less,
only on the Government reading, because that was
the only big task actually due the next day. Without
time labels, Stephen would have had a much hazier
understanding of his free time, so he probably
wouldn’t have started this reading until later in the
afternoon (for the most part, students don’t like to
start any work without a large block of free time
ahead of them). Remember, however, that this
assignment took a couple of hours to complete, so
that means if Stephen had waited until the afternoon
to start, he would have finished only this single task
by 5:00, with the Econ problem set and Anthro paper
topic likely falling by the wayside. Instead, Stephen
ended up finishing six tasks by 5:00, leaving plenty
of time for exercise and debauchery during the
evening.

As you can see from the case study, this simple
time-management system, which requires only a few
minutes of planning each day, made Stephen
significantly more productive and significantly less
stressed. It will do the same for you. In other words,
five minutes every morning and a sheet of scrap
paper in your pocket are enough to transform you
from a stressed-out student struggling to get things
done, into an organized, relaxed, finely tuned
academic machine.

If you remember one lesson from this book, it
should be the lesson of this case study: A little
organization goes a hell of a long way.

### Step 2 - Declare War on Procrastination

In the previous section we introduced a simple time-
management system to help you plan your day
intelligently. That was the easy part. Anyone can
spend five minutes to figure out what they should be
doing. The real challenge is marshaling the
motivation to actually do the work once it’s
scheduled. Without some control over your schedule,
you cannot be a happy and successful student—no
matter how good your intentions.

As you might expect, in conducting interviews for
this book, I put a significant focus on the issue of
procrastination. Anyone who makes straight As has
clearly found a way to consistently get work done
when it needs to be done, and I wanted to find out
how. As it turns out, however, I was in for a surprise.

Every student I interviewed was asked the
following question: “How do you defeat
procrastination?” As soon as the first responses
were returned, it became clear that something was
not quite right. I received answers such as:

> “I don’t.”

> “Rarely.”

> “I didn’t.”

> “I don’t think that you can.”

These were not the responses that I expected—it
didn’t make sense! Everything else they told me
about how they studied and wrote papers clearly
indicated that these scholastic studs were kicking
some very serious procrastinatory ass, so why were
they all claiming they didn’t defeat procrastination?
What was going on here? Fortunately, many
students went on to qualify this first reaction, and it
was in these qualifications that I began to figure out
what they really meant.

“I don’t think that you can,” was how Lee, a
straight-A student from Columbia, began his answer,
but he soon added: “You just have to try to limit it.”

Ryan, a straight-A Dartmouth student, started by
claiming, “Really, I don’t defeat procrastination.” But
then he continued: “Or, at least, I don’t think I do...
although, I suppose, compared to the majority of
students, I’m not as bad as I think.”

“I don’t know that I’ve yet defeated
procrastination,” was how Christine, a straight-A
Harvard student, began before concluding: “but I’ve
found ways to make this inevitable tendency less
destructive.”

Over time, these extended responses began to
paint a clear picture. When the straight-A students
answered “I don’t defeat procrastination,” they really
meant to say “I don’t defeat the urge to
procrastinate.” And this makes perfect sense. To put
it simply, some work just plain sucks, and you, like
the straight-A students interviewed for this book, will
want to procrastinate on this sucky work. It’s
unavoidable. Therefore, the goal in this step is not to
teach you how to love all work and never feel like
procrastinating ever again. Instead, I’m going to
describe some targeted strategies to help you
sidestep this unavoidable urge when it arises—not
destroy it altogether. This is how straight-A students
prevent procrastination from destabilizing their
schedule. They don’t rely only on willpower and good
intentions, but instead deploy an arsenal of specific,
tested rules that help them short-circuit their natural
desire to procrastinate. These students, of course,
aren’t perfect, and they still occasionally put off work
for no good reason. But overall their strategies made
them significantly more effective at following a study
plan then their peers—and this made all the
difference.

What follows are five anti-procrastination battle
plans drawn directly from my straight-A interviews.
These techniques are not theoretical; they are
exhaustively used by real students to beat down
procrastination again and again. Trust them. Put
them into practice immediately. Make them into a
habit. The effect will be immediate. You may never
fully rid yourself of the urge to procrastinate, and
that’s okay. But with the right strategies in place, you
can rid yourself of the fear that you’ll always give in to
that urge.

#### Procrastination Battle Plan #1: *Keep a work progress journal*

Think about the last time that you procrastinated on
something important. You can probably recall some
of the wishy-washy excuses your mind concocted for
delaying the work. Something along the lines of “*I
don’t have all the materials here with me now, but if
I waited until tomorrow, I could get started right away
with everything I need*, ” or “*It’s getting late, and my
concentration is waning, it would be a waste to start
now, so I will wait to tackle this when I’m fresh in the
morning.*” Why are these excuses necessary? Why
don’t we simply think: “*This is boring, and I’m lazy,
so I’m not going to do it*, ” which is much closer to the
truth? The answer is that your ego is a powerful
force. We procrastinate, but we don’t want to admit
to ourselves that we procrastinate. So we make
excuses to ourselves to avoid the truth.

A work progress journal is a simple tool that takes
advantage of this reality to help you defeat
procrastination. It works as follows: Buy a cheap
spiral notebook, and keep it near your calendar.
Each morning, when you work out your schedule for
the day, quickly jot down in the notebook the date
and the most important tasks that you are scheduled
to get done. At the end of the day, if you’ve
completed all of these tasks, simply jot down *all
completed* . If you failed to complete some tasks,
record this, along with a quick explanation.

The system adds only an extra minute to your
morning routine and requires only an extra minute
each night before you go to sleep. It’s simple enough
to turn into a habit. What’s amazing, however, is the
journal’s immediate effect. Having to record, in ink,
on paper, that you procrastinated over a task for no
good reason is a powerful blow to your ego. It might
be easy to *tell* yourself a few weak excuses for
putting off a tedious assignment, but when you have
to *record* these same excuses on paper their
foolishness is exposed. You can no longer get away
with lame rationalizations. This is especially true if
you continue to delay the same task day after day.
After seeing all of those excuses pile up in your
journal, there will be no escape from reality: You are
being lazy! Your ego won’t like this truth, so it will
kick-start your motivation in an effort to avoid it.

The journal, in this way, acts like a personal drill
sergeant, sitting on your shoulder and yelling into
your ear: “ *Soldier, I want you to go get me a pillow,
because I know I must be dreaming. I thought I just
saw you consider not starting your paper this
afternoon, and I knnnoooowwww you wouldn’t try to
pull that crap with me standing right next to you!
Now go grab your notes and get workin’ before I
make you record your laziness in ink where
everyone can see it!*”

Many students, myself included, don’t keep a
journal all the time, but use it to help them get through
unusually busy periods. For example, my work
progress journal was a key force in getting me
through my senior fall semester, which involved
classes, grad school applications, and the writing of
my first book. Others have had great success with
the journal to keep focused on their LSAT
preparation while juggling the demands of regular
class work. Some students go so far as to use the
system with a friend, agreeing to review each other’s
journal once a week. As Christine from Harvard
suggests: “If you have a friend in the same class,
check up on each other’s progress.” And even if you
can’t find a willing journal partner, there are other
ways to use friends to jump-start your drive: “It helps
to simply tell your roommates of your goals, and
have them guilt-trip you into working.”

#### Procrastination Battle Plan #2: *Feed the Machine*

Low energy breeds procrastination. Most students
know the feeling—your mind starts to feel sluggish,
you begin to read whole pages of text without
remembering a single word, and writing coherent
notes becomes a Herculean task.

It’s almost impossible to motivate yourself to stick
to a schedule under these mental conditions.
Accordingly, during long work periods, you need to
feed your body the fuel it needs to perform at its
peak. Think of your brain like a machine. If you want
to defeat procrastination, you need to provide it with
the energy necessary to concentrate and win the
fight. Without proper care, it will turn against you.

The nutritional rules for maximizing your mental
energy while studying are simple:

1. **Drink water constantly.** Have a water bottle
with you, or make frequent trips to the water
fountain. One of my favorite study spots had a
dispenser of mini–paper cups next to the
fountain. My habit was to drink five mini-cups of
water every forty-five minutes. It worked
wonders toward keeping my mind humming and
my energy high. Your body needs water to
function. Hydration increases your energy,
masks boredom-induced food cravings, and
staves off sleepiness. And don’t worry about the
inevitable side effect of so much drinking. As
Greta, a straight-A Dartmouth student, exults:
“Frequent bathroom trips keep me awake.”

2. **Monitor your caffeine intake carefully.** 
Don’t drink more than one large caffeinated
beverage in any one-hour period. While a Coke
or cup of coffee can heighten your
concentration, too much caffeine in a short
period will make you jumpy and unfocused. If
you’re a coffee drinker, start off with a strong
brew to jump-start your mind, but switch to
decaf, tea, or just water for the next hour or two
before returning to another strong drink.

3. **Treat food as a source of energy, not
satisfaction .** When studying, carefully choose
snacks that promise a long-term energy boost.
Try vegetables, fruit, anything whole grain, lean
proteins, peanuts, or natural granola bars.
Refined carbohydrates, such as sugar and
white flour, will provide only a quick energy rush
followed immediately by a damaging energy
drain and increased appetite. Avoid these
unhealthy snacks at all costs while working. If
you follow rule one, your frequent water
consumption will dull the cravings for specific
foods, making it much easier to stick with
healthier fare.

4. **Don’t skip meals.** Snacks alone are not
enough to fuel your mind for long periods. Even
on the busiest of days, eat regular meals. If you
skip breakfast to get a jump start on studying, or
put off lunch until the late afternoon so you can
finish your reading, you will experience more
hunger than your snacks can effectively satisfy.
Hunger, and the corresponding low blood sugar,
will rob you of your ability to concentrate and set
you up to succumb to procrastination. So keep
your meals regular. If you’re pressed for time,
eat fast. Grab a sandwich from a less-populated
dining hall and sit alone, or bring part of the
meal back to your study location. But never miss
meals altogether.

#### Procrastination Battle Plan #3: *Make an event out of the worst tasks*

Some tasks are so horrible that even just the thought
of beginning them can send chills down your spine.
For me, these included writing personal statements
for graduate school applications. Other students
cringe at having to type the first few paragraphs of a
long paper, composing cover letters for job
applications, or beginning the slog through a
hopelessly large reading assignment on a
hopelessly boring topic (I can’t help but remember
one particularly descriptive article I had to read
about the various clays used in ancient Cypriot vase-
making).

It seems to take an extraordinary effort to start
these projects before the last possible minute. But it
doesn’t have to be this difficult. As Laura, a straight-
A Dartmouth student, explains: “When studying for
something I don’t especially enjoy, I try to make an
event out of it.” Find an out-of-the-way restaurant,
coffee shop, or bookstore café. It helps if your
location is farther than walking distance from
campus. Set a time to bring your work there, and if
you don’t have a car, arrange to be dropped off and
picked up later, or choose a location that takes a
while to reach by foot so you won’t be tempted to
leave right away. Tell everyone you know that you will
be gone during this time, and talk up how horrible the
work is that you have to complete. The more people
who know about your quest, the harder it will be for
you to cancel it.

The novelty of the location, plus its distance from
campus, will help jump-start your motivation to tackle
your horrible task once there.

“I find the change of scenery puts your body in
work mode, just as going to the office is supposed
to,” explains Sean, a straight-A student from Yale.
You went through a lot of effort to get to your unusual
study nook, and there is no easy way to be
distracted. Campus is far away, and therefore so are
your friends, your TV, the student center, and your
Internet connection. You are sitting alone at a table in
a public place, surrounded by strangers, and if you
don’t start doing something soon, people will begin
to wonder: *Who is that odd student sitting alone
and staring into space? Is she a drifter? Is she
going to snap and kill us all? What’s her deal?*

“It’s just too awkward to sit there while staring at
other people,” says Laura, “so inevitably I will end up
reading whatever material I’ve brought with me.” As
always, the hardest part is beginning. But once you
start slogging through your assignment, the pain will
slip away, you will hit your stride, and before you
know it, your ride will have arrived and that once
terrifying task will be safely completed.

#### Procrastination Battle Plan #4: *Build a routine*

Your schedule varies each day. But you should be
able to identify at least one hour, on each weekday,
that is consistently free. If you have an early class,
make this the hour right after it lets out. If you have a
late morning class, make this the hour right before it
starts. In general, the morning and early afternoon
are the best times to find these consistently free
hours. Time in the late afternoon and evening is
much more susceptible to being hijacked by
unexpected events as your friends finish up their
classes and start knocking on your door.

Once you’ve identified these protected hours, use
them to do the same work each week. For example,
maybe Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are for
chipping away at your History reading assignments,
and Tuesdays and Thursdays are for making
progress on your weekly Statistics problem set. The
idea is to build a routine in which you use the same
reserved time slot each week to do the same thing,
with the goal of transforming these slices of work into
a habit, something you no longer have to convince
yourself to do.

“I figured out pretty early on the most annoying
thing about bad habits—namely, their tenacity—
could be very useful if it was applied to other things,”
explains Simon, a straight-A student from Brown. “I
found that good habits, like making sure I do [certain
work at the same time each week], are really hard to
get rid of.”

Unfortunately, these five hours a week are
probably not enough to complete all of your work (if
only that were true!). But they do represent five hours
of productivity that didn’t exist before. And, more
important, the first work of the day breaks the seal on
your motivation. Once you have accomplished one
big task, it becomes much easier to tackle more. So
follow Simon’s advice, and let this simple good habit
greatly reduce the effort required to launch a
productive day.

#### Procrastination Battle Plan #5: *Choose your hard days*

Hard days are inescapable at college. Sometimes
you simply have more work due than you can handle
with a well-balanced schedule. In these cases,
relaxation and socializing have to take a backseat to
your study obligations. As Jeremy, a straight-A
student from Dartmouth, admits: “Occasionally I end
up setting aside one full day where I just lock myself
in my room with some food and grind through it.” You
can’t avoid these hard days, but you can control their
impact.

If you see a large number of deadlines looming
just over the horizon, you can be sure that there will
be some hard days in your near future. Here’s the
secret: Plan them in advance. Don’t wait until the
deadlines are so close that you have no choice but
to buckle down. Instead, scout out one or two days to
preemptively designate as “hard.” By choosing them
ahead of time, you can space them out so that you
never have two hard days in a row, and you won’t be
caught off guard by this sudden burst of intensity. Try
to plan relaxing, nonacademic activities immediately
before and after these days. This will ease their
impact. As Jeremy explains: “If I work all day
Saturday, I will let myself go out hard on Saturday
night and take Sunday off.”

In addition, you should prepare yourself mentally.
Tell friends which days are going to be hard, warn
them not to expect much communication from you,
and ask for their encouragement. If all of your friends
know that Tuesday is going to be a rough day for
you, then you will be much more likely to keep busy
and do the work. It would be embarrassing, after all,
to talk up your upcoming hard day, garnering
sympathy and support from friends, and then be
discovered that afternoon, still in your boxers,
experimenting with the use of your toes as an
alternative to your missing remote control.

By proactively scheduling hard days on a regular
basis, you reduce their negative impact. When you
are forced into an all-day work marathon against
your wishes, you feel drained and abused. If that
same day has been planned and hyped for the past
week, you’ll come away feeling invigorated by your
accomplishment. You expected the challenge,
prepared for the challenge, and survived it. This
strategy is more psychological than time saving, but
the effect is powerful. Take ownership of your
schedule and you are more likely to respect it.

### Step 3 - Choose When, Where, and How Long

The little things count. This is especially true when it
comes to studying. Before we get caught up in the
details of exactly how to review and synthesize
material, there are some basic questions that we
must address first: *When* during the day should you
study? *Where* should you go to study? *How long*
should you study before taking a break? The right
answers to these questions will boost your
productivity, allowing you to squeeze more work out
of even less time. The wrong answers will slow you
down and make this process more difficult than it
needs to be. Straight-A students, I found out, devote
a lot of thought to these questions; they recognize
how these seemingly little details can make or break
their study efforts and have experimented extensively
to discover the most effective strategies. Step #3 will
walk you through the results of these experiments
and present tested approaches for each of these
three crucial study skills.

**QUESTION: When is the best time to study?**

**ANSWER: *Early*.**

“I like doing work in one big chunk upon getting back
from class, or doing it in between classes,
depending on my schedule,” says Simon from
Brown. “I try to never leave it until late at night.”
Simon’s plan emphasizes an important reality about
studying: You’re most effective between when you
wake up and when you eat dinner. You should
accomplish as much work as possible during this
time.

This advice runs counter to most students’
instincts. To many, the evening seems ideal for work.
Why? Because the morning and afternoon are
crowded. Classes, meals, meetings, and other
activities take over these hours, leaving few
continuous periods for really settling in and getting
things done. Night, on the other hand, seems like
one long, uninterrupted stretch of good work time.
Right? Wrong!

First, nighttime is not as long as you think. By the
time you finish dinner, gather your materials, and
finally begin your work, you really have only a few
hours left before it becomes too late and your desire
to sleep hijacks your concentration.

Second, nighttime is not as free as you think. It’s
prime time. Inevitably some can’t-miss TV show
nags for your attention, or the loud music of a party
down the hall beckons seductively. Night is when
people most want to socialize. You see movies at
night. You go to parties at night. Shows, speakers,
and other campus performances happen at night.

People gather back at their dorm rooms to gossip
and distract each other. Few among us have
achieved the required level of nerd-dom necessary
to resist such temptations—and we shouldn’t have
to.

Finally, nighttime is when your body begins to wind
down. After a long day of activity, it’s ready to begin
a slow descent into sleep. Even before it gets late,
the energy available to your mind has already
declined. By 7:00 or 8:00 P.M ., your focus is weak at
best.

For these reasons, you must minimize the amount
of work you do after dinner. At the same time,
however, it’s true that working during the day can
also be complicated. As mentioned, there are few
continuous stretches of free time in the morning and
afternoon. Don’t fear this fractured schedule. Bring
your materials with you throughout the day, and fill in
any small patches of free time with productive work.
As Wendy, a straight-A student from Amherst,
explains: “I try to take a book I need to read along
with me all the time, in case some free time pops up
while I’m doing something else.” Doris, from
Harvard, has a similar philosophy, admitting that she
sneaks in work between meetings or classes, using
small blocks of thirty or forty-five minutes at a time. If
you follow this approach, you’ll be surprised at the
amount of work you can squeeze into your hectic
daytime schedule.

The trick is to be efficient. If you have an hour in
between classes, head straight from the first class to
a library, or similar study location, near the second
class. Mentally prepare yourself on the way over so
that when you hit the study spot you can become
productive within seconds. Also, be sure to avoid
your dorm room or other public places as much as
possible during the day. You need to separate your
work mind-set from your relaxation mind-set. By
hanging around your room, or the student center, you
are much more likely to become distracted and let a
potentially productive work period slip away at the
expense of a mundane conversation. Become a
ghost during the day. Like an academic ninja, slip
from hidden study spot to hidden study spot, leaving
only an eerie trail of completed work behind you (see
the next question, “*Where should you study?*” for
more advice on choosing the right locations).

The idea here is not to become antisocial. When
you’re done for the day, feel free to go have fun!
Party like a demon. You aren’t missing out on an
important social event by avoiding some half-assed
gossip between classes. The more meaningful
experiences will happen later, at the frats or in your
dorm room after everyone is done with classes for
the day. Remember: “*Work hard, play hard*” is
always better than “*Work kind of hard, play kind of
hard.*”

In addition to the extra energy and better focus that
you gain by studying early, the spread-out nature of
this schedule makes it less of a strain. Working for
forty-five minutes, running to class, working for an
hour, going to another class, then working another
forty-five minutes before grabbing lunch is much less
odious then sitting down and working for two and a
half hours straight. This approach also makes
optimal use of your time. Most students simply waste
these free chunks during the day. By taking
advantage of daytime study pockets, you’re freeing
up valuable nighttime hours to go out and have the
sort of fun that defines the college experience.

**QUESTION: Where should you study?**

**ANSWER: *In isolation.***

Identify a number of isolated study spots spread out
across campus and rotate through these hidden
locations when you study. Any place in your dorm or
house is off-limits, as are the big public study
spaces in your main library. As Greta from
Dartmouth explains: “If you stay in your dorm, it
seems like no one is studying...because they
aren’t.” This atmosphere is not conducive to
concentration. Look for less-visited libraries away
from the center of campus, and search out carrels
high up in the stacks or buried down in the
basement. Always keep your eyes open for the next
great hidden study spot—small libraries in the
buildings of student organizations, a hole-in-the-wall
coffee shop, or the local public library are all
potential concentration gold mines.

You need multiple locations for two reasons. First,
as you move through your day, squeezing in study
sessions between classes, it’s nice to always know
of a nearby study spot. Second, changing locations
prevents you from burning out at any one place. This
is the strategy followed by Doris from Harvard, who
explains: “to keep my mind stimulated, I regularly
rotate between different venues.”

The isolation of these spots is important for the
obvious reason: It shields you from distraction. That
little procrastination devil on your shoulder is an
incredible salesman. If you give him even a glimpse
of an alternative to your work, then he will close the
deal. To neutralize this devil, isolate him. Don’t let
him see your couch, the cute girls tossing Frisbees
on the quad, or your friends chatting in your dorm
room lounge. If you cut yourself off from the outside
world during your work hours, then you have a much
better chance of completing what needs to get done,
and, as an added bonus, the resulting increase in
concentration will help you get your work done faster.

Many students will admit that there is something a
bit dramatic about working in exaggerated isolation.
It may sound corny, but quarantining yourself in a
study bunker seems to increase the importance of
the work you are about to tackle. You can almost
imagine the voice of a grave military officer saying,
“Son, we’re all counting on you...good luck,” as you
head off to your silent nook. This kind of gravitas is
lacking when you flop down on your couch with a
textbook propped up on your chest and your
roommate in the chair next to you struggling to learn
an obnoxious Dave Matthews song on his out-of-
tune guitar. As Christine from Harvard states plainly:
“Studying in bed has never worked.”

These mind games are not trite. Don’t
underestimate the importance of psychology in
becoming an effective student. Almost every
straight-A student interviewed for this book followed
some variant of this isolation strategy. Some went so
far as to wear earplugs or travel great distances
from campus to eliminate any chance of distraction.
They understood the mental edge their surroundings
provided—and you should, too.

**QUESTION: How long should you study?**

**ANSWER: *No more than one hour at a time without a break*.**

Your break needs to be only five to ten minutes, but
it’s important that you take an intellectual breather
during this period. This means you should find
something you can concentrate on, for just a few
minutes, which has nothing to do with the work you
were completing right before the break. Read a
newspaper article or send a few e-mails. That should
be enough. This disengagement helps refresh your
mind and facilitates the process of finding new
angles and insights when you begin your work again.
Some students brought a novel or newspaper with
them, and then read a chapter or an article at every
break. Others chose a project for the day—perhaps
writing a long e-mail to a friend they hadn’t seen in
ages, or building a list of options for an upcoming
vacation—that they could work on bit by bit with each
break they took.

Even when you feel like you are on a roll, keep
taking regular breaks. Over the long run, it will
maximize your energy and retention of the material.
As Laura from Dartmouth recounts: “I swear I get
more done taking regular breaks than I would if I just
worked straight through.”

Why does this timing work the best? I don’t know
exactly. Some cognitive science research concludes
that about fifty minutes is the optimal learning period
to maximize the material synthesized per time unit.
For example, the Web site for the IPFW Center for
Academic Support and Advancement states:
“Studies suggest you should study in 40 or 50 minute
increments for maximum retention. After
approximately 40 minutes, take a short break (5
minutes) and continue studying. Without a break,
retention is about 30% after 2 hours.” But we don’t
have to get bogged down with these scientific
details. The main reason I advocate this timing is
because almost every straight-A student interviewed
for this book followed a similar plan. When asked
how long they studied in a single sitting, all but a few
of their answers fell somewhere between half an
hour and an hour:

> “Not more than an hour,” replied Chris.
> 
> “One hour, then I get up and do something else for
> a bit,” replied Melanie.
> 
> “About forty minutes to an hour,” replied Ryan.
> 
> “One hour on, fifteen minutes off,” replied Lydia.
> 
> “One to one and a half hours. Then I would always
> take a break,” replied Lacey.

And the list goes on, as response after response
revealed a similar strategy. The point here should be
clear: Through trial and error, dozens of high-
performing students have individually stumbled
across this same technique—study for an hour, then
take a break—so you should trust it too.

### Part One Cheat Sheet
