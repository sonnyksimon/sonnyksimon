**H**ere’s a simple truth: *Most college students are
terrible at studying.*

It’s not really their fault. When students arrive at
college, they’re on their own. No one ever takes
them aside to teach them the right way to study, so
most students just make it up as they go along. For
example, when an exam date looms, the typical
student pulls out his books and notes and then
cloisters himself in his dorm study lounge or at the
desk in his room. At this point, he begins reviewing,
almost at random, poring over as many notes and
chapters as he can manage, with frequent breaks to
converse with friends and check e-mail, until, finally,
his will to continue completely flickers out. If he’s
particularly industrious, he might manage to pull an
all-nighter. Otherwise, he’ll probably call it quits by
midnight. The next day, he takes the exam, blearyeyed,
completely unsure of what grade to expect.
Occasionally, this approach earns him an A-, but, for
the most part, he remains wearily ensconced in the
world of Bs and the occasional C.

There are two problems with this approach. First,
there’s the *timing*. In Part One, I introduced the term
“pseudo-work” to describe this unfortunate habit of
studying in long, low-intensity, fatigue-saturated
marathons of pain. To counter this behavior, we
discussed some intelligent time-management
strategies to help you spread out your work into
small, high-intensity bursts.

The second problem with this approach is the
*technique*. As shown in the scenario above, the
typical student studies by performing rote review—
the reading and rereading of assignments and notes
as many times as possible. The idea behind this
strategy is that somehow, if the material crosses
before your eyes enough times, the key ideas will
stick around long enough to be later regurgitated
during the exam. Here’s the problem with rote
review: It’s a horrible way to study.

First of all, it doesn’t work. Even though you spend
a lot of time, you don’t end up actually learning the
material well. Methodically trying to reread every
source covered in class is an incredibly inefficient
way to prepare. And because it’s boring, your mind
quickly fatigues, and once your mind shuts down, you
can forget about synthesizing complicated
arguments. To successfully learn even a modest
amount of information using this technique requires
an absurd number of hours. The second problem
with rote review is that it’s really painful. There is no
way around it: Cramming is mind numbing,
especially when you have a hopelessly large amount
of material to review.

Here’s the good news: It doesn’t have to be this
way. Not convinced? What follows are real quotes
from some of the straight-A students interviewed for
this book:

* “I never do all-nighters.”
* “I have a great deal of free time.”
* “Balance is very important for me.”
* “I have tons of free time nearly every day.”
* “[I worked hard at first,] but by junior and senior
year I was having a blast.”
* “I spent relatively little time in college doing
homework or reading.”
* “I get my work done quickly in the morning and
then have plenty of time for uninterrupted
playing.”

Many students find these claims hard to believe
because they contradict a cherished piece of
conventional wisdom: *High-scoring students must
be grinds*. Where does this belief come from? For
one thing, as Matthew, a straight-A student from
Brown, explains: “There are people who devote their
lives to The Grind.” And these students tend to be
very visible. They complain incessantly about the
amount of work they have to do, constantly check in
with their friends to compare study hours, and can be
seen camped out in the library during most times of
the day. If you encounter enough of these public
grinds, it can begin to seem like they represent what
is necessary to achieve academic success.

However, there is another, more insidious reason
why this belief persists. **Most students incorrectly
believe rote review is the only way to study.**
Think about this for a moment: If you assume that all
studying is equal, then the conclusion that all straight-
A students are grinds becomes unavoidable. We
noted earlier that making high grades with rote
review requires an absurd number of hours;
therefore, if rote review is the only way to study, then
high-scoring students *must* be studying a lot more
than the average student.

This is why, before we continue, you must first
understand and accept this crucial fact: **There are
many, many different ways to study (and rote
review is not one of the better ones).** Once you
reject the idea that all studying is equal, and instead
make the crucial connection that studying is like any
other skill—and as with any skill, it can be done well
or done poorly—then the premise of this book starts
to make sense. Non-grind straight-A students are
not unexplainable or incredible. They have simply
mastered, either through aggressive trial and error
or interactions with older straight-A students, study
strategies that are far superior to rote review.

Let me put it another way. If we make an analogy
between college and professional basketball, then
the rote-reviewing students are all shooting the ball
underhand granny style, while the non-grind straight-
A students are those who’ve figured out how to shoot
a jump shot. It doesn’t matter if the rote reviewers
practice those granny shots twice as many hours as
the straight-A students; when it’s game time, the
jump shooters are going to score a lot more points.
Better technique trumps more effort.

Part Two will teach you, in essence, how to shoot
an academic jump shot. It covers the nuts and bolts
of smart exam preparation—the many small
techniques, refined by straight-A students over
countless semesters, that add up to a much better
way to study. Forget everything you think you know
about preparing for exams, and approach the steps
that follow with an open mind. Some of this advice
will make immediate sense, some will seem
obvious, and some will surprise you. But just
remember that these tactics are not arbitrary, they
are not based on one guy’s experience, and they
certainly are not abstract theories spouted by some
self-proclaimed expert. Instead, they are the realistic
strategies developed by real straight-A students to
ace tests under the harsh demands of a college
workload. If you combine these tested study skills
with the time-management techniques taught in Part
One, you will find yourself scoring higher, learning
more, and studying less than you previously thought
possible.

**Quizzes vs. Exams**

In general, all of the advice described in Part Two
will work for both quizzes and exams. But in the case
of quizzes, it’s not always necessary to put in quite
as much effort (though it certainly doesn’t hurt).

But first things first—let’s get our definitions
correct. Keep in mind that professors often use the
terms quiz and exam interchangeably, so forget
what they say and make your own determination
about a given test. Here’s a simple rule to follow: **If
the test is worth less than 15 percent of your
final grade, it’s a quiz; otherwise, it’s an exam. If
the test is worth only 5 percent or less of your
grade, designate this a *tiny* quiz.**

Don’t spend too much time on tiny quizzes. Even if
you fail one, it still probably won’t change your final
letter grade. And if you’re attending classes and
keeping up with your reading, you should be able to
score above average with little to no preparation.

For larger quizzes, you can more or less follow the
advice in this section as written, but feel free to move
more quickly through the review-focused steps
(Steps #3 and #4). If you don’t master every last
topic that might be covered on a quiz, that’s okay. A
missed question here or there won’t make a big
difference on your final grade. And if you treat every
quiz like a midterm, you’re going to overload your
schedule. Quizzes are checkups, not comprehensive
evaluations, so treat them as such.

The only exception, of course, is if your grade is in
danger. If you’re in academic trouble, perhaps due to
a poor performance on a previous exam or paper,
then go all out in your review. If you apply the full
force of the study strategies that follow, you will be
guaranteed to knock any quiz out of the park.

### Step 1 - Take Smart Notes

First things first: Always go to class! The importance
of this rule cannot be overemphasized. It doesn’t
matter if your class meets at 6:00 A.M., at the top of
the steepest hill on campus, on Saturday mornings—
wake up, get dressed, and get to the lecture on time.
As Lydia, a straight-A student from Dartmouth,
explains, if you skip class, “it’ll take twice as long
studying to make up for what you missed.” This is
why class attendance is so important. Not because
learning is power, or it’s what your parents would
want you do, but because it saves you time. If you
attend class regularly, you will significantly cut down
on the amount of studying required to score high
grades. Don’t make this negotiable. Even if you’re
tired, hung over, or extremely busy, find a way to
make it there.

Of course, just going to class isn’t enough by itself.
To reduce your study time, you have to also take
good notes once you’re there. Keep this in mind:
Note-taking is an art form. Doing it well requires
expert guidance, and fortunately there is no better
place to look for expert guidance than real straight-A
students. Here are their proven note-taking
strategies.

**Gather the Right Materials**

When I was a freshman, less than half of my class
brought a laptop to campus. The year I graduated,
over 95 percent of incoming freshmen brought
laptops. By the time you read this, laptops will more
or less be the de facto standard for undergraduates
across the country, and this is a great advancement
for the cause of collegiate note-taking. Why? I think
David, another Dartmouth student, put it best: “Use
your laptop. *Seriously!* You will be overwhelmed by
the quality and legibility of your notes…it’s really a
no-brainer.”

Yes, it may seem somewhat geeky. But it’s
becoming increasingly common, and besides, the
academic advantages far outweigh any minor social
stigma. As mentioned by David: You type much
faster than you write, so the laptop will allow you to
record more points in more detail. This increased
detail and readability will make it easier to study
come test time—and that should be all you need to
hear.

If you don’t have a laptop, then make sure you
have one notebook for every class and a pen that
you are comfortable with. Try to write clearly. You
might even consider typing summaries of your notes
at the end of each week. I sometimes followed this
strategy in my pre-laptop days, and found that it
saved me significant study time in the long run.

There is, however, one obvious exception to this
laptop rule: For math, science, economics, and
engineering courses that are heavy on numbers and
equations, pencil and paper are acceptable. Some
people are comfortable approximating complicated
mathematical symbols on their laptop, while others
are not. If you fall into the latter category, don’t worry
about using a notebook; for a technical course, the
difference between the two mediums is less
important.

Finally, you should also have one folder for each
class. Every piece of paper you receive during a
lecture—outlines, assignment descriptions, reading
excerpts—should be dated and put in this folder. The
same goes for graded problem sets and papers.
The folders will make it much easier to find materials
when you need them later for review.

A lot of “experts” recommend needlessly
complicated additions to this basic material list.
They talk of using multiple colored pens, special
notebooks, and organized class binders equipped
with portable three-hole punches. Real straight-A
students ignore this nonsense. As Anna, a straight-A
Dartmouth student, warns: “A lot of students focus on
making their notebooks look pretty and then forget
about the content.” Put your notes on your laptop and
your loose papers in a folder, and you’ll be fine.

**Take Smart Notes in Nontechnical Courses (What’s the Big Idea?)**

A “nontechnical course” refers to any course outside
of math, science, economics, and engineering.
We’re talking about English, history, psychology,
political science, anthropology, classics, education
—basically anything that doesn’t make frequent use
of mathematical formulas. These courses are the
domain of ridiculously long reading assignments and
dignified professors lecturing from behind a podium.

The key to doing well in these courses is
straightforward: **Identify the big ideas.** That’s what
it all comes down to. Exams in nontechnical courses
focus entirely on big ideas—they require you to
explain them, contrast them, and reevaluate them in
the light of new evidence. If you are aware of, and
understand, all of the big ideas presented in the
course, these tasks are not so difficult, and strong
grades will follow.

As you would expect, lectures are a major source
of these big ideas. Identifying them, however, is not
a trivial task. Professors ramble. And they rarely start
a class by clearly identifying the big ideas that will be
explored. Instead, they tend to dive right in, leaving
the poor student to separate on his own the
interesting conclusions from the digressions.

“A whole lot of superfluous things are said in each
class,” explains Jeremy, a straight-A student from
Dartmouth. “You have to learn how to pick out which
is which.” This is hard, and as such, most students
don’t take very good notes in nontechnical courses,
which has major ramifications when it comes time to
study. If your notes don’t already clearly identify the
big ideas, then you are going to be forced to try to
figure them out from scratch while reviewing. Allow
me to the spoil this particular ending for you: Unless
you set aside dozens of hours to prepare, you’re not
going to accomplish this task, and your grade on the
exam becomes a crapshoot. If the exam happens to
ask questions that deal with the random assortment
of ideas that you do know, then you might do okay,
but if it happens to ask questions that deal with many
of the big ideas that you never learned, then you will
do poorly.

Obviously, you want to avoid this situation. The
solution is to figure out how to take notes that clearly
identify and explain all of the big ideas that are
presented so that you can review them later without
spending any extra time. Let’s jump right into the
details of how to accomplish this goal.

> **Format Your Notes Aggressively**

When you first arrive at the classroom, date your
notes and record the title of the day’s lecture, if it’s
available. If you’re using a laptop, create a separate
*notes* directory for each class. Save your document
in this folder with the date in the file name. This will
make it easier to organize the material when you
review.

When it comes to formatting the text itself, the
basic rule to follow is that anything that makes the
information easier to read is fair game. You don’t
need a consistent scheme. Don’t be afraid to use
aggressive text formatting to help emphasize
important points. On a computer, smart students
often make use of bold fonts and lists to help
organize their thoughts. When using a pen and
paper, underlining, indentations, drawing boxes
around ideas, and bullet points also help structure
the information. If you’re defining a word, make it
bold. If you’re writing down an exception to the last
observation you recorded, start with: “**HOWEVER:**
…” Christine, a straight-A Harvard student, suggests
that you “develop your own shorthand—‘esp.’ for
‘especially,’ ‘N.A.’ for ‘North America,’ etc.” Skip
lines with wild abandon, use tabs freely, change the
font size, write entire sentences in all caps, throw
around asterisks like penny candy—have fun and do
whatever helps you visualize the important concepts.

“Your notes are for you and you alone,” explains
Lee, a straight-A Columbia student. “They don’t have
to make sense to anyone else.”

> **Capture Big Ideas by Using the Question/Evidence/Conclusion Structure**

The central challenge to note-taking in
nontechnical courses is deciding what to write down.
Some students attempt to record the lecture
verbatim. *Don’t do this.* “The best advice I can give
on note-taking,” explains Doris, a straight-A student
from Harvard, “is not to try to write down everything
the professor says, because that is both impossible
and counterproductive.” Put simply: You can’t write
that fast! And you will end up expending too much
energy capturing exact words as opposed to
identifying big ideas. Instead, remember the
following structure:

> **Question**

> **Evidence**

> **Conclusion**

Most big ideas in nontechnical courses are
presented in this structure. Why? Professional
academics think in terms of questions. This is how
they see the world. To them, in order to find big
ideas, you must first find questions and then follow a
path of evidence to a corresponding conclusion.

Accordingly, this is also how professors lecture.
They offer up questions and then walk you through
various pieces of evidence en route to an interesting
conclusion. **You should take advantage of this
reality by recording all your notes in a
Question/Evidence/Conclusion format.**

The basics of this approach are simple. All of the
information you write down during class should be
associated with a well-labeled question. Each
question should be paired with a well-labeled
conclusion. When you’re done, your notes for a given
lecture should consist only of a bunch of
question/conclusion pairs, each separated by points
of evidence that support why the conclusion is a
reasonable answer to the question. In other words,
your goal is to fit all the facts and observations
spewed out during class into this nice simple
structure.

Keep in mind that professors don’t always state
the question. Often they jump right into the evidence
and leave it to you to deduce the question being
discussed. Don’t be afraid to jot down
“**QUESTION:**” and then leave the rest of the line
blank as you begin recording evidence. Once you
figure out what the professor’s talking about, you can
go back and fill in this blank.

The same holds true for conclusions. Professors
will sometimes hint at a conclusion but not come
right out and present a neat endpoint for the current
discussion. In this case, it will be up to you to
synthesize the question, evidence, and professor’s
hints into a conclusion of your own. This is the
important part. When you formulate a conclusion, you
are cementing a big idea. If you can’t finalize a
conclusion before the professor moves on to the next
question, simply jot down “**CONCLUSION:**” and
plan to come back later during a lull in the lecture, or
immediately following class, to fill in the blank.

Something to remember: Conclusions are rarely
simple. Professors often offer conclusions that only
summarize the complexity of the issue. Consider, for
example, the following question from a literature
class: “Who was the greatest novelist of the twentieth
century?” A simple conclusion might be:
“Hemingway.” And the evidence, in this case, might
be several points highlighting the influence and
originality of Hemingway’s work. On the other hand,
it’s much more likely that a college professor would
offer up a more complicated conclusion to this
question, perhaps something like: “Different
generations answered this question differently,
depending on the prevailing social issues of their
time.” In this case, the evidence could be excerpts
from scholars of various periods talking about their
favorite novelists, as well as some observations
concerning the differing social climates during each
of these eras.

The more classes you take, the better you will
become at summarizing a complicated conclusion.
In the beginning, don’t be afraid to ask questions to
help figure out if your conclusions are correct or not.
If you’re shy, go up to the professor after class or
become a regular during his office hours. Professors
love this kind of student interaction. Use it to help
polish your conclusion-sleuthing skills.

Another important tip: Take full advantage of lulls
in the lecture. As hinted above, some professors
shoot out information so fast that there doesn’t seem
to be enough time to jot down every question or think
about every conclusion. Sometimes it takes all of
your energy just to keep up with the evidence. In this
case, wait for slow spots. When the professor
wanders off on a personal anecdote, or a student
interrupts with an inane question, use this time to
hurriedly go back and clean up what you have been
throwing down. Record conclusions, clarify
questions, and add illustrative formatting to pieces of
evidence. If you’re not rushed, spend five minutes
after class to polish your notes before packing up.
As Doris from Harvard explains: “It’s important to
read over your notes right after class to absorb them
and make corrections and additions, otherwise you’ll
be susceptible to entirely forgetting what was
covered that day.” These little moments and
adjustments will make a big difference when it
comes time to review.

Finally, remember that the number of questions
presented in a discussion can vary significantly,
depending on the class. One professor may spend
an entire lecture exploring a single question,
whereas another may move through a dozen small
questions in the space of an hour. Often, a professor
will introduce a major question for the whole lecture
and then spend the time exploring smaller questions
that help build toward an overarching conclusion.
Again, the more classes you take, the more intuitive
these structures will become. “If you pay attention to
the contours of a professor’s lecture,” explains
Matthew from Brown, “you can determine what he
feels is important.” Listen for pauses, which usually
follow key points, and remember that personal
anecdotes are often spun during less important parts
of the class.

In general, there is no right or wrong way to break
up a particular lecture into question/conclusion pairs,
so just find a structure that more or less works. Feel
free to mess around with your notes as you go along.
Add or remove questions on the fly. If certain
evidence doesn’t seem to fit with any particular
question, no matter how hard you try, that’s okay, just
label it as such. Professors have been known to
wander. By simply *attempting* to associate all
information with questions and conclusions, you are
already a large step ahead of most students when it
comes to understanding and internalizing the big
ideas.

> **A Brief Example**

Presented below is an excerpt from a real college
lecture on the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.
It’s followed by an example of how a straight-A
student might take notes on this discussion. Keep in
mind that the student here would have probably first
recorded the evidence bullet points on the fly and
then gone back later to fill in the question and
conclusion once he had a better idea of where the
professor was heading. Also note that the evidence
features a lot of aggressive formatting: It’s split up
into lists, with words often bolded and capitalized to
emphasize their importance. There is no consistent

**Notes on excerpt:**

**QUESTION: Was there really a big
“fall” of the Roman Empire?**

* Roman Empire having a catastrophic decline
and fall, at the hands of savage barbarians,
popular idea since eighteenth century

* **Edward Gibbon**—wrote book blaming fall on
Christians and barbarians. Christian beliefs
replaced heroic virtues, weakened military, let
barbarians take over.

* Rostovsteff and Toynbee—wrote books
with similar arguments

  - EXCEPT: Not Christians’ fault, but social and
  political problems that led to weak empire.

* HOWEVER: These views are “geographically
narrow.”

  - Authors lived in Europe, so they focused on
  Europe, only place where it looked like Empire
  had a big fall.
  
  - Loss of power in Mediterranean region not
  nearly so pronounced…no real big decline and
  fall there.

**CONCLUSION: The idea of a catastrophic
decline and fall of the Roman Empire
became popular in European circles, but it
overstates reality…too much emphasis on
what happened to the Empire in Europe.**

> **The Discussion Exception**

Nontechnical courses will occasionally make use
of the class discussion format, in which the professor
lets the students lead a discussion on a preselected
topic or group of topics. The note-taking strategies
described above will not fit this environment. When
students lead a discussion, you should no longer
expect neatly packaged big ideas. Instead, you end
up with a lot of random observations surrounding the
occasional gem, so in this circumstance, employ the
following simplified note-taking strategy:

Clearly label the topic of the discussion. If a
student makes a point that strikes you as insightful,
jot it down. If *you* think up a point that strikes you as
insightful, first jot it down, then raise your hand and
offer it to the class. Participation keeps you focused.
If a student says something you feel is mistaken or
irrelevant, just ignore it. And, most important, if the
professor chimes in, write down what he says and
underline it several times. You better believe that his
points are insightful. By the end of class, you will be
left with a topic followed by a relatively short list of
interesting insights. That’s all you need. Discussions
are supposed to help jog your thinking and perhaps
offer interesting ideas for upcoming paper
assignments. This approach to note-taking focuses
on that goal by identifying only interesting insights
and encouraging you to synthesize your own.

**Take Smart Notes in Technical Courses
(Where’s the Problem?)**

Technical courses describe any subject that makes
heavy use of mathematical formulas or computer
code—for example, math, science, engineering,
economics, computer science, and quantitative
social science. The note-taking strategies for these
courses differ significantly from the strategies we just
covered for nontechnical courses. In fact, the
strategies here are actually much simpler. As Greta,
a straight-A student from Dartmouth, explains, for
technical courses you should focus on “capturing lots
of detailed explanations of problems…the more
notes the better.” In other words, you can forget
about big ideas. **The key to taking notes in a
technical course is to record as many sample
problems as possible.** When you study, these
sample problems will prove to be your most
important resource. Accordingly, your entire focus in
a technical class should be to write down, as
faithfully as possible, the steady stream of examples
provided by your professor. Let’s take a closer look
at how to do this:

> **Don’t Read Your Assignments, but Do Keep Them Handy**

Most technical courses have assigned reading.
These readings are usually textbook chapters, and
they typically focus on a specific technique or
formula. **Don’t do this reading.** It may sound
blasphemous, but it’s the reality of college-level
technical courses: Very few students actually do the
technical reading ahead of time. Why? Because the
exact same material will be covered in class. If you
don’t understand a topic *after* it’s presented by the
professor, then you can go back and use the reading
to help fill in the blanks. This ordering of events is
much more efficient.

What you should do, however, is bring your
reading to class. Smart students follow the
professor’s examples with their textbook open. This
significantly improves your understanding of the
techniques the first time they are presented, and it
helps sharpen your questions when you get lost.
Make sure that you have your assigned reading
material gathered and ready to go before class
begins.

> **Prioritize Your Note-taking**

In a perfect world, you would successfully capture
every single problem discussed in class, as well as
every single answer, and all the steps in between.
Don’t expect this to happen. Professors move too
quickly for you to record all of their examples, so you
must learn to prioritize your note-taking.

First priority: *Record the problem statement and
answer.*

Even in the fastest class, there should be time to
jot down the questions and final solutions. If you’re in
the middle of writing down steps when the professor
gives the answer and moves on to the next problem,
skip the rest of the steps, record the answer, and
move on too. You can try to come back during a lull
to fill in more of the steps (so leave space), but even
if you don’t, having only the problem and answer will
still be useful for review later.

Second priority: *Question the confusing.*

Students who do well in technical courses are
those who closely follow the problems being
presented and then insist on asking questions when
they don’t understand a specific step. Is this
annoying? A little bit. Does it really improve your
understanding of the techniques being presented?
Absolutely. If you can’t ask a question, then at least
clearly mark where you got confused. Write a bunch
of question marks or circle the line in your notes; this
will help you later when you study. Remember,
however, the more questions you get answered in
class, the less legwork you will have to do later. So
raise your hand, be confident, and ask away!

Third priority: *Record the steps of the sample
problem.*

The reality of technical courses is that the
professor usually goes slow only on the first sample
problem presented for a new technique. These are
usually the only sample problems for which you can
capture all of the steps. So pay particular attention at
the beginning of the discussion, and don’t get
discouraged if subsequent problems fly by too fast
for you to record all of the intermediate steps.

Final priority: *Annotate the steps.*

If you get ahead of the professor on a given
problem, and you have time to kill, annotate the
steps with little explanations of what they accomplish
or why they’re important. In the cases where you do
have time for these annotations, they will prove
immensely useful when you review.
