**H**ere’s a simple truth: *Most college students are
terrible at studying.*

It’s not really their fault. When students arrive at
college, they’re on their own. No one ever takes
them aside to teach them the right way to study, so
most students just make it up as they go along. For
example, when an exam date looms, the typical
student pulls out his books and notes and then
cloisters himself in his dorm study lounge or at the
desk in his room. At this point, he begins reviewing,
almost at random, poring over as many notes and
chapters as he can manage, with frequent breaks to
converse with friends and check e-mail, until, finally,
his will to continue completely flickers out. If he’s
particularly industrious, he might manage to pull an
all-nighter. Otherwise, he’ll probably call it quits by
midnight. The next day, he takes the exam, blearyeyed,
completely unsure of what grade to expect.
Occasionally, this approach earns him an A-, but, for
the most part, he remains wearily ensconced in the
world of Bs and the occasional C.

There are two problems with this approach. First,
there’s the *timing*. In Part One, I introduced the term
“pseudo-work” to describe this unfortunate habit of
studying in long, low-intensity, fatigue-saturated
marathons of pain. To counter this behavior, we
discussed some intelligent time-management
strategies to help you spread out your work into
small, high-intensity bursts.

The second problem with this approach is the
*technique*. As shown in the scenario above, the
typical student studies by performing rote review—
the reading and rereading of assignments and notes
as many times as possible. The idea behind this
strategy is that somehow, if the material crosses
before your eyes enough times, the key ideas will
stick around long enough to be later regurgitated
during the exam. Here’s the problem with rote
review: It’s a horrible way to study.

First of all, it doesn’t work. Even though you spend
a lot of time, you don’t end up actually learning the
material well. Methodically trying to reread every
source covered in class is an incredibly inefficient
way to prepare. And because it’s boring, your mind
quickly fatigues, and once your mind shuts down, you
can forget about synthesizing complicated
arguments. To successfully learn even a modest
amount of information using this technique requires
an absurd number of hours. The second problem
with rote review is that it’s really painful. There is no
way around it: Cramming is mind numbing,
especially when you have a hopelessly large amount
of material to review.

Here’s the good news: It doesn’t have to be this
way. Not convinced? What follows are real quotes
from some of the straight-A students interviewed for
this book:

* “I never do all-nighters.”
* “I have a great deal of free time.”
* “Balance is very important for me.”
* “I have tons of free time nearly every day.”
* “[I worked hard at first,] but by junior and senior
year I was having a blast.”
* “I spent relatively little time in college doing
homework or reading.”
* “I get my work done quickly in the morning and
then have plenty of time for uninterrupted
playing.”

Many students find these claims hard to believe
because they contradict a cherished piece of
conventional wisdom: *High-scoring students must
be grinds*. Where does this belief come from? For
one thing, as Matthew, a straight-A student from
Brown, explains: “There are people who devote their
lives to The Grind.” And these students tend to be
very visible. They complain incessantly about the
amount of work they have to do, constantly check in
with their friends to compare study hours, and can be
seen camped out in the library during most times of
the day. If you encounter enough of these public
grinds, it can begin to seem like they represent what
is necessary to achieve academic success.

However, there is another, more insidious reason
why this belief persists. **Most students incorrectly
believe rote review is the only way to study.**
Think about this for a moment: If you assume that all
studying is equal, then the conclusion that all straight-
A students are grinds becomes unavoidable. We
noted earlier that making high grades with rote
review requires an absurd number of hours;
therefore, if rote review is the only way to study, then
high-scoring students *must* be studying a lot more
than the average student.

This is why, before we continue, you must first
understand and accept this crucial fact: **There are
many, many different ways to study (and rote
review is not one of the better ones).** Once you
reject the idea that all studying is equal, and instead
make the crucial connection that studying is like any
other skill—and as with any skill, it can be done well
or done poorly—then the premise of this book starts
to make sense. Non-grind straight-A students are
not unexplainable or incredible. They have simply
mastered, either through aggressive trial and error
or interactions with older straight-A students, study
strategies that are far superior to rote review.

Let me put it another way. If we make an analogy
between college and professional basketball, then
the rote-reviewing students are all shooting the ball
underhand granny style, while the non-grind straight-
A students are those who’ve figured out how to shoot
a jump shot. It doesn’t matter if the rote reviewers
practice those granny shots twice as many hours as
the straight-A students; when it’s game time, the
jump shooters are going to score a lot more points.
Better technique trumps more effort.

Part Two will teach you, in essence, how to shoot
an academic jump shot. It covers the nuts and bolts
of smart exam preparation—the many small
techniques, refined by straight-A students over
countless semesters, that add up to a much better
way to study. Forget everything you think you know
about preparing for exams, and approach the steps
that follow with an open mind. Some of this advice
will make immediate sense, some will seem
obvious, and some will surprise you. But just
remember that these tactics are not arbitrary, they
are not based on one guy’s experience, and they
certainly are not abstract theories spouted by some
self-proclaimed expert. Instead, they are the realistic
strategies developed by real straight-A students to
ace tests under the harsh demands of a college
workload. If you combine these tested study skills
with the time-management techniques taught in Part
One, you will find yourself scoring higher, learning
more, and studying less than you previously thought
possible.

**Quizzes vs. Exams**

In general, all of the advice described in Part Two
will work for both quizzes and exams. But in the case
of quizzes, it’s not always necessary to put in quite
as much effort (though it certainly doesn’t hurt).

But first things first—let’s get our definitions
correct. Keep in mind that professors often use the
terms quiz and exam interchangeably, so forget
what they say and make your own determination
about a given test. Here’s a simple rule to follow: **If
the test is worth less than 15 percent of your
final grade, it’s a quiz; otherwise, it’s an exam. If
the test is worth only 5 percent or less of your
grade, designate this a *tiny* quiz.**

Don’t spend too much time on tiny quizzes. Even if
you fail one, it still probably won’t change your final
letter grade. And if you’re attending classes and
keeping up with your reading, you should be able to
score above average with little to no preparation.

For larger quizzes, you can more or less follow the
advice in this section as written, but feel free to move
more quickly through the review-focused steps
(Steps #3 and #4). If you don’t master every last
topic that might be covered on a quiz, that’s okay. A
missed question here or there won’t make a big
difference on your final grade. And if you treat every
quiz like a midterm, you’re going to overload your
schedule. Quizzes are checkups, not comprehensive
evaluations, so treat them as such.

The only exception, of course, is if your grade is in
danger. If you’re in academic trouble, perhaps due to
a poor performance on a previous exam or paper,
then go all out in your review. If you apply the full
force of the study strategies that follow, you will be
guaranteed to knock any quiz out of the park.

### Step 1 - Take Smart Notes

First things first: Always go to class! The importance
of this rule cannot be overemphasized. It doesn’t
matter if your class meets at 6:00 A.M., at the top of
the steepest hill on campus, on Saturday mornings—
wake up, get dressed, and get to the lecture on time.
As Lydia, a straight-A student from Dartmouth,
explains, if you skip class, “it’ll take twice as long
studying to make up for what you missed.” This is
why class attendance is so important. Not because
learning is power, or it’s what your parents would
want you do, but because it saves you time. If you
attend class regularly, you will significantly cut down
on the amount of studying required to score high
grades. Don’t make this negotiable. Even if you’re
tired, hung over, or extremely busy, find a way to
make it there.

Of course, just going to class isn’t enough by itself.
To reduce your study time, you have to also take
good notes once you’re there. Keep this in mind:
Note-taking is an art form. Doing it well requires
expert guidance, and fortunately there is no better
place to look for expert guidance than real straight-A
students. Here are their proven note-taking
strategies.

**Gather the Right Materials**

When I was a freshman, less than half of my class
brought a laptop to campus. The year I graduated,
over 95 percent of incoming freshmen brought
laptops. By the time you read this, laptops will more
or less be the de facto standard for undergraduates
across the country, and this is a great advancement
for the cause of collegiate note-taking. Why? I think
David, another Dartmouth student, put it best: “Use
your laptop. *Seriously!* You will be overwhelmed by
the quality and legibility of your notes…it’s really a
no-brainer.”

Yes, it may seem somewhat geeky. But it’s
becoming increasingly common, and besides, the
academic advantages far outweigh any minor social
stigma. As mentioned by David: You type much
faster than you write, so the laptop will allow you to
record more points in more detail. This increased
detail and readability will make it easier to study
come test time—and that should be all you need to
hear.

If you don’t have a laptop, then make sure you
have one notebook for every class and a pen that
you are comfortable with. Try to write clearly. You
might even consider typing summaries of your notes
at the end of each week. I sometimes followed this
strategy in my pre-laptop days, and found that it
saved me significant study time in the long run.

There is, however, one obvious exception to this
laptop rule: For math, science, economics, and
engineering courses that are heavy on numbers and
equations, pencil and paper are acceptable. Some
people are comfortable approximating complicated
mathematical symbols on their laptop, while others
are not. If you fall into the latter category, don’t worry
about using a notebook; for a technical course, the
difference between the two mediums is less
important.

Finally, you should also have one folder for each
class. Every piece of paper you receive during a
lecture—outlines, assignment descriptions, reading
excerpts—should be dated and put in this folder. The
same goes for graded problem sets and papers.
The folders will make it much easier to find materials
when you need them later for review.

A lot of “experts” recommend needlessly
complicated additions to this basic material list.
They talk of using multiple colored pens, special
notebooks, and organized class binders equipped
with portable three-hole punches. Real straight-A
students ignore this nonsense. As Anna, a straight-A
Dartmouth student, warns: “A lot of students focus on
making their notebooks look pretty and then forget
about the content.” Put your notes on your laptop and
your loose papers in a folder, and you’ll be fine.

**Take Smart Notes in Nontechnical Courses (What’s the Big Idea?)**

A “nontechnical course” refers to any course outside
of math, science, economics, and engineering.
We’re talking about English, history, psychology,
political science, anthropology, classics, education
—basically anything that doesn’t make frequent use
of mathematical formulas. These courses are the
domain of ridiculously long reading assignments and
dignified professors lecturing from behind a podium.

The key to doing well in these courses is
straightforward: **Identify the big ideas.** That’s what
it all comes down to. Exams in nontechnical courses
focus entirely on big ideas—they require you to
explain them, contrast them, and reevaluate them in
the light of new evidence. If you are aware of, and
understand, all of the big ideas presented in the
course, these tasks are not so difficult, and strong
grades will follow.

As you would expect, lectures are a major source
of these big ideas. Identifying them, however, is not
a trivial task. Professors ramble. And they rarely start
a class by clearly identifying the big ideas that will be
explored. Instead, they tend to dive right in, leaving
the poor student to separate on his own the
interesting conclusions from the digressions.

“A whole lot of superfluous things are said in each
class,” explains Jeremy, a straight-A student from
Dartmouth. “You have to learn how to pick out which
is which.” This is hard, and as such, most students
don’t take very good notes in nontechnical courses,
which has major ramifications when it comes time to
study. If your notes don’t already clearly identify the
big ideas, then you are going to be forced to try to
figure them out from scratch while reviewing. Allow
me to the spoil this particular ending for you: Unless
you set aside dozens of hours to prepare, you’re not
going to accomplish this task, and your grade on the
exam becomes a crapshoot. If the exam happens to
ask questions that deal with the random assortment
of ideas that you do know, then you might do okay,
but if it happens to ask questions that deal with many
of the big ideas that you never learned, then you will
do poorly.

Obviously, you want to avoid this situation. The
solution is to figure out how to take notes that clearly
identify and explain all of the big ideas that are
presented so that you can review them later without
spending any extra time. Let’s jump right into the
details of how to accomplish this goal.

> **Format Your Notes Aggressively**

When you first arrive at the classroom, date your
notes and record the title of the day’s lecture, if it’s
available. If you’re using a laptop, create a separate
*notes* directory for each class. Save your document
in this folder with the date in the file name. This will
make it easier to organize the material when you
review.

When it comes to formatting the text itself, the
basic rule to follow is that anything that makes the
information easier to read is fair game. You don’t
need a consistent scheme. Don’t be afraid to use
aggressive text formatting to help emphasize
important points. On a computer, smart students
often make use of bold fonts and lists to help
organize their thoughts. When using a pen and
paper, underlining, indentations, drawing boxes
around ideas, and bullet points also help structure
the information. If you’re defining a word, make it
bold. If you’re writing down an exception to the last
observation you recorded, start with: “**HOWEVER:**
…” Christine, a straight-A Harvard student, suggests
that you “develop your own shorthand—‘esp.’ for
‘especially,’ ‘N.A.’ for ‘North America,’ etc.” Skip
lines with wild abandon, use tabs freely, change the
font size, write entire sentences in all caps, throw
around asterisks like penny candy—have fun and do
whatever helps you visualize the important concepts.

“Your notes are for you and you alone,” explains
Lee, a straight-A Columbia student. “They don’t have
to make sense to anyone else.”

> **Capture Big Ideas by Using the Question/Evidence/Conclusion Structure**

The central challenge to note-taking in
nontechnical courses is deciding what to write down.
Some students attempt to record the lecture
verbatim. *Don’t do this.* “The best advice I can give
on note-taking,” explains Doris, a straight-A student
from Harvard, “is not to try to write down everything
the professor says, because that is both impossible
and counterproductive.” Put simply: You can’t write
that fast! And you will end up expending too much
energy capturing exact words as opposed to
identifying big ideas. Instead, remember the
following structure:

> **Question**

> **Evidence**

> **Conclusion**

Most big ideas in nontechnical courses are
presented in this structure. Why? Professional
academics think in terms of questions. This is how
they see the world. To them, in order to find big
ideas, you must first find questions and then follow a
path of evidence to a corresponding conclusion.

Accordingly, this is also how professors lecture.
They offer up questions and then walk you through
various pieces of evidence en route to an interesting
conclusion. **You should take advantage of this
reality by recording all your notes in a
Question/Evidence/Conclusion format.**

The basics of this approach are simple. All of the
information you write down during class should be
associated with a well-labeled question. Each
question should be paired with a well-labeled
conclusion. When you’re done, your notes for a given
lecture should consist only of a bunch of
question/conclusion pairs, each separated by points
of evidence that support why the conclusion is a
reasonable answer to the question. In other words,
your goal is to fit all the facts and observations
spewed out during class into this nice simple
structure.

Keep in mind that professors don’t always state
the question. Often they jump right into the evidence
and leave it to you to deduce the question being
discussed. Don’t be afraid to jot down
“**QUESTION:**” and then leave the rest of the line
blank as you begin recording evidence. Once you
figure out what the professor’s talking about, you can
go back and fill in this blank.

The same holds true for conclusions. Professors
will sometimes hint at a conclusion but not come
right out and present a neat endpoint for the current
discussion. In this case, it will be up to you to
synthesize the question, evidence, and professor’s
hints into a conclusion of your own. This is the
important part. When you formulate a conclusion, you
are cementing a big idea. If you can’t finalize a
conclusion before the professor moves on to the next
question, simply jot down “**CONCLUSION:**” and
plan to come back later during a lull in the lecture, or
immediately following class, to fill in the blank.

Something to remember: Conclusions are rarely
simple. Professors often offer conclusions that only
summarize the complexity of the issue. Consider, for
example, the following question from a literature
class: “Who was the greatest novelist of the twentieth
century?” A simple conclusion might be:
“Hemingway.” And the evidence, in this case, might
be several points highlighting the influence and
originality of Hemingway’s work. On the other hand,
it’s much more likely that a college professor would
offer up a more complicated conclusion to this
question, perhaps something like: “Different
generations answered this question differently,
depending on the prevailing social issues of their
time.” In this case, the evidence could be excerpts
from scholars of various periods talking about their
favorite novelists, as well as some observations
concerning the differing social climates during each
of these eras.

The more classes you take, the better you will
become at summarizing a complicated conclusion.
In the beginning, don’t be afraid to ask questions to
help figure out if your conclusions are correct or not.
If you’re shy, go up to the professor after class or
become a regular during his office hours. Professors
love this kind of student interaction. Use it to help
polish your conclusion-sleuthing skills.

Another important tip: Take full advantage of lulls
in the lecture. As hinted above, some professors
shoot out information so fast that there doesn’t seem
to be enough time to jot down every question or think
about every conclusion. Sometimes it takes all of
your energy just to keep up with the evidence. In this
case, wait for slow spots. When the professor
wanders off on a personal anecdote, or a student
interrupts with an inane question, use this time to
hurriedly go back and clean up what you have been
throwing down. Record conclusions, clarify
questions, and add illustrative formatting to pieces of
evidence. If you’re not rushed, spend five minutes
after class to polish your notes before packing up.
As Doris from Harvard explains: “It’s important to
read over your notes right after class to absorb them
and make corrections and additions, otherwise you’ll
be susceptible to entirely forgetting what was
covered that day.” These little moments and
adjustments will make a big difference when it
comes time to review.

Finally, remember that the number of questions
presented in a discussion can vary significantly,
depending on the class. One professor may spend
an entire lecture exploring a single question,
whereas another may move through a dozen small
questions in the space of an hour. Often, a professor
will introduce a major question for the whole lecture
and then spend the time exploring smaller questions
that help build toward an overarching conclusion.
Again, the more classes you take, the more intuitive
these structures will become. “If you pay attention to
the contours of a professor’s lecture,” explains
Matthew from Brown, “you can determine what he
feels is important.” Listen for pauses, which usually
follow key points, and remember that personal
anecdotes are often spun during less important parts
of the class.

In general, there is no right or wrong way to break
up a particular lecture into question/conclusion pairs,
so just find a structure that more or less works. Feel
free to mess around with your notes as you go along.
Add or remove questions on the fly. If certain
evidence doesn’t seem to fit with any particular
question, no matter how hard you try, that’s okay, just
label it as such. Professors have been known to
wander. By simply *attempting* to associate all
information with questions and conclusions, you are
already a large step ahead of most students when it
comes to understanding and internalizing the big
ideas.

> **A Brief Example**

Presented below is an excerpt from a real college
lecture on the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.
It’s followed by an example of how a straight-A
student might take notes on this discussion. Keep in
mind that the student here would have probably first
recorded the evidence bullet points on the fly and
then gone back later to fill in the question and
conclusion once he had a better idea of where the
professor was heading. Also note that the evidence
features a lot of aggressive formatting: It’s split up
into lists, with words often bolded and capitalized to
emphasize their importance. There is no consistent
scheme being applied here. The formatting is just
what might come naturally to the student during the
heat of the moment, to help him understand and
underscore the concepts being presented.

**Notes on excerpt:**

**QUESTION: Was there really a big
“fall” of the Roman Empire?**

* Roman Empire having a catastrophic decline
and fall, at the hands of savage barbarians,
popular idea since eighteenth century

* **Edward Gibbon**—wrote book blaming fall on
Christians and barbarians. Christian beliefs
replaced heroic virtues, weakened military, let
barbarians take over.

* Rostovsteff and Toynbee—wrote books
with similar arguments

  - EXCEPT: Not Christians’ fault, but social and
  political problems that led to weak empire.

* HOWEVER: These views are “geographically
narrow.”

  - Authors lived in Europe, so they focused on
  Europe, only place where it looked like Empire
  had a big fall.
  
  - Loss of power in Mediterranean region not
  nearly so pronounced…no real big decline and
  fall there.

**CONCLUSION: The idea of a catastrophic
decline and fall of the Roman Empire
became popular in European circles, but it
overstates reality…too much emphasis on
what happened to the Empire in Europe.**

***

> **The Discussion Exception**

Nontechnical courses will occasionally make use
of the class discussion format, in which the professor
lets the students lead a discussion on a preselected
topic or group of topics. The note-taking strategies
described above will not fit this environment. When
students lead a discussion, you should no longer
expect neatly packaged big ideas. Instead, you end
up with a lot of random observations surrounding the
occasional gem, so in this circumstance, employ the
following simplified note-taking strategy:

Clearly label the topic of the discussion. If a
student makes a point that strikes you as insightful,
jot it down. If *you* think up a point that strikes you as
insightful, first jot it down, then raise your hand and
offer it to the class. Participation keeps you focused.
If a student says something you feel is mistaken or
irrelevant, just ignore it. And, most important, if the
professor chimes in, write down what he says and
underline it several times. You better believe that his
points are insightful. By the end of class, you will be
left with a topic followed by a relatively short list of
interesting insights. That’s all you need. Discussions
are supposed to help jog your thinking and perhaps
offer interesting ideas for upcoming paper
assignments. This approach to note-taking focuses
on that goal by identifying only interesting insights
and encouraging you to synthesize your own.

**Take Smart Notes in Technical Courses
(Where’s the Problem?)**

Technical courses describe any subject that makes
heavy use of mathematical formulas or computer
code—for example, math, science, engineering,
economics, computer science, and quantitative
social science. The note-taking strategies for these
courses differ significantly from the strategies we just
covered for nontechnical courses. In fact, the
strategies here are actually much simpler. As Greta,
a straight-A student from Dartmouth, explains, for
technical courses you should focus on “capturing lots
of detailed explanations of problems…the more
notes the better.” In other words, you can forget
about big ideas. **The key to taking notes in a
technical course is to record as many sample
problems as possible.** When you study, these
sample problems will prove to be your most
important resource. Accordingly, your entire focus in
a technical class should be to write down, as
faithfully as possible, the steady stream of examples
provided by your professor. Let’s take a closer look
at how to do this:

> **Don’t Read Your Assignments, but Do Keep Them Handy**

Most technical courses have assigned reading.
These readings are usually textbook chapters, and
they typically focus on a specific technique or
formula. **Don’t do this reading.** It may sound
blasphemous, but it’s the reality of college-level
technical courses: Very few students actually do the
technical reading ahead of time. Why? Because the
exact same material will be covered in class. If you
don’t understand a topic *after* it’s presented by the
professor, then you can go back and use the reading
to help fill in the blanks. This ordering of events is
much more efficient.

What you should do, however, is bring your
reading to class. Smart students follow the
professor’s examples with their textbook open. This
significantly improves your understanding of the
techniques the first time they are presented, and it
helps sharpen your questions when you get lost.
Make sure that you have your assigned reading
material gathered and ready to go before class
begins.

> **Prioritize Your Note-taking**

In a perfect world, you would successfully capture
every single problem discussed in class, as well as
every single answer, and all the steps in between.
Don’t expect this to happen. Professors move too
quickly for you to record all of their examples, so you
must learn to prioritize your note-taking.

First priority: *Record the problem statement and
answer.*

Even in the fastest class, there should be time to
jot down the questions and final solutions. If you’re in
the middle of writing down steps when the professor
gives the answer and moves on to the next problem,
skip the rest of the steps, record the answer, and
move on too. You can try to come back during a lull
to fill in more of the steps (so leave space), but even
if you don’t, having only the problem and answer will
still be useful for review later.

Second priority: *Question the confusing.*

Students who do well in technical courses are
those who closely follow the problems being
presented and then insist on asking questions when
they don’t understand a specific step. Is this
annoying? A little bit. Does it really improve your
understanding of the techniques being presented?
Absolutely. If you can’t ask a question, then at least
clearly mark where you got confused. Write a bunch
of question marks or circle the line in your notes; this
will help you later when you study. Remember,
however, the more questions you get answered in
class, the less legwork you will have to do later. So
raise your hand, be confident, and ask away!

Third priority: *Record the steps of the sample
problem.*

The reality of technical courses is that the
professor usually goes slow only on the first sample
problem presented for a new technique. These are
usually the only sample problems for which you can
capture all of the steps. So pay particular attention at
the beginning of the discussion, and don’t get
discouraged if subsequent problems fly by too fast
for you to record all of the intermediate steps.

Final priority: *Annotate the steps.*

If you get ahead of the professor on a given
problem, and you have time to kill, annotate the
steps with little explanations of what they accomplish
or why they’re important. In the cases where you do
have time for these annotations, they will prove
immensely useful when you review.

### Step 2 - Demote Your Assignments

Most students spend way too much time on reading
assignments and problem sets, causing them to feel
constantly overwhelmed by their work. This is a
problem. If day-to-day assignments dominate your
schedule, then there is no time left to prepare
properly for the bigger exams and projects.

Straight-A students hate excessive schoolwork
just as much as the next student, which is why they
have mastered the art of minimizing the time spent
on assignments while still learning exactly what they
need to know. This chapter details their strategies
for powering through readings and problem sets with
a minimum of stress. Follow this advice, and your
assignments will be reduced from a source of
energy-draining tedium into manageable tasks you
can actually learn from.

**Work Constantly**

Most college students depend on “day-before”
assignment planning, meaning they never start an
assignment until the day before it’s due. This might
be the simplest scheduling decision, but it creates
many problems. Large assignments will quickly
transform from potentially interesting to tedious to
painful when tackled in one monolithic, last-minute
chunk of time. And, if two or more assignments
happen to be due on the same day (which will
happen often), you will be forced into a frenzied work
marathon that will produce lackluster results at best.

Smart students avoid these issues by working
constantly on assignments, in small chunks, every
day. “I try to sit down every Sunday night and plan out
the week,” explains Simon, a straight-A student from
Brown. “My goal is to make sure that I don’t have too
much work on busy days and that I do at least a little
bit each day.”

For example, if you have a problem set due every
week, complete one problem a day, one hour at a
time. Don’t spend five hours the night before. The
same goes for reading assignments—knock off a
chapter a day, and you’ll never find yourself spending
a lonely night with a textbook and a six-pack of Red
Bull.

Bear in mind that even if you get caught up on all
of your assignments for a given class, you should
continue to work. For example, if it’s Sunday
morning and you have already finished your reading
for Monday’s history class, and you have time to
spare, break out a book and do a little of the reading
for Wednesday’s history class. This doesn’t mean
that you should study like crazy twenty-four hours a
day. Don’t stay up until 2 A.M. Sunday night trying to
finish the entire week’s load. But on days where you
happen to be ahead of schedule, and you have
already put aside time to work on a certain class,
take advantage of this fortuitous situation to get
ahead. Once you get used to working a little bit every
day, you’ll be surprised by how often this situation
might arise.

Straight-A students use this strategy whenever the
opportunity presents itself, since getting ahead on
class work frees up time to focus on big projects like
paper writing or test preparation. It may seem
superstitious, but easy weeks never seem to come
in pairs. They’re like the calm before a storm: If you
find yourself with time to spare, start getting ahead
on your obligations, as a hurricane of deadlines is
probably lurking just over the horizon.

**Don’t Read Everything**

“Doing all of your reading in college is a luxury most
of us can’t afford—especially if you’re involved in
extracurriculars,” explains Tyler, a straight-A student
from Duke. “It’s important to triage your
assignments: What do you need to read? What do
you need to skim? And what can you skip entirely?”
Lee from Columbia puts it as follows: “Reading can
get overwhelming, and very few people I know do it
all—that could drive a man insane!” And Chris, a
straight-A student from Dartmouth, states his advice
simply: “Don’t read everything on the syllabus, of
course.”

These students all emphasize the same important
point: It’s impossible to read every single thing
assigned to you in every class. Sometimes you are
simply given more pages to cover than you have
hours in the day to complete. Therefore, it will help
you to remember the following: **Don’t do all of your
reading.** Colleges should mount this slogan on big
bronze plaques and hang them up in every dorm
room on campus—if every college freshman knew
this secret, it would probably prevent a lot of
unnecessary panic attacks.

The hard part, of course, is deciding what reading
is important and what can be skipped. A lot of this
decision-making ability comes from practice—the
more college classes you take, the better you will
become at identifying the exact level of importance
of every assignment. There are, however, some
general tips that can help you pick up this talent
sooner rather than later. The techniques that follow
are used by straight-A students to systematically
identify which readings to spend time on and which
to ignore.

For example, in most college courses there are
one or two sources that show up on the reading list
for almost every lecture. We will call these *favored
sources*—they’re usually a textbook or a course
reader, and they provide the basic structure for the
course by outlining key facts and arguments in a
condensed form. **Always read the assignments
from favored sources.**

Professors usually augment these favored
sources with a variety of supplemental readings that
provide context or analyze certain arguments and
events in more detail. These supplemental readings
are often academic papers, transcripts of speeches,
or chapters from books—and they are typically
fascinating. But they are also typically expendable,
and you should not plan on reading them all. Instead,
if your time is limited during a particular week, then
your strategy should be to select only the most
important supplemental readings for review.

Of course, college is about learning, and if you
have time to get through all of the assigned reading,
then you definitely should. Your professor selected all
of these readings because he or she felt they were
important for your complete understanding of the
given topic, and the more you read, the smarter you
become. But as Tyler stated earlier, reading
everything assigned is a “luxury” that you can’t
always afford.

So how do you decide which supplemental
readings to review, which to skim, and which to
skip? Straight-A students follow this simple
hierarchy:

> Readings that **make an argument** are more
> important than

> readings that **describe an event or person**,
> which are more important than

> readings that only **provide context** (i.e.,
> speech transcripts, press clippings).

Assignments at the top of this hierarchy require at
least enough attention to allow you to identify the
argument being made. They don’t have to be read
as carefully as a favored source, but you should
spend enough time with them to gain a good
understanding of their theses. Assignments in the
middle of the hierarchy merit skimming, since they
introduce facts that can clarify relevant arguments. A
quick pass through should highlight enough of these
facts to be useful, and you certainly don’t need to
carefully review every detail. Assignments at the
bottom can usually be skipped, since professors will
discuss what’s important about them during class.
Make sure, therefore, that you bring these readings
to class and take careful notes.

Now let’s look at a couple of sample entries from
real college syllabi to illustrate how to apply this
strategy in practice.

> **Example #1**

The following entry comes from the syllabus of a
history course titled The Emergence of Modern
America.

***

> **Class #20: Vietnam**

> **Reading:**

> Maier, Pauline, et al. (2003) *Inventing America*.
> New York: Norton, 952–957, 968–971.
>
> Johnson, Lyndon B. (1992) “Speech at Johns
> Hopkins University,” in George Katsiaficas, ed.,
> *Vietnam Documents: American and
> Vietnamese Views of the War*. Armonk, N.Y.:
> Sharpe, 200–205. [electronic reserve]
>
> O’Brien, Tim. (1998) “On the Rainy River,” in
> *The Things They Carried*. New York: Random
> House, 39–61.

***

Let’s assume that your schedule is swamped
when you come across this assignment listing. What
should you do? First, note that readings from
*Inventing America* (a textbook) show up for almost
every lecture in this syllabus, so this is clearly a
favored source. Following our rule from above, you
should definitely read the pages assigned from this
textbook. The two other assignments look like
supplemental readings, so let’s apply our
importance hierarchy to figure out how much
attention to devote to each.


The Lyndon Johnson speech looks like a source
of context, the lowest rung on our importance
hierarchy. Your best bet in this case is to print out a
copy and bring it with you to class. This way, if the
professor makes some important points regarding
Johnson’s rhetoric, you can follow along and make
notes on the pages. But don’t bother giving it more
than a quick skim in advance.

The Tim O’Brien excerpt comes from a great
book. It’s a semifictionalized account of the draft
during the Vietnam era, and it was a finalist for the
Pulitzer Prize. Again, if you had the time, it would
definitely be worth doing a careful reading of this
excerpt, since it’s likely to be the most engaging and
colorful. But if you happen to be overloaded at this
point, you need to apply the importance hierarchy.
Because this is a description of an event, it’s only on
the second rung. Therefore, these twenty-two pages
require a quick ten- to twenty-minute skim at best.
As always, however, bring the book to class. If the
professor mentions specific points relating to the
book, you want to be able to follow along.

It should be noted that fiction is tricky. In this case,
the Tim O’Brien book was a fictional account of a
historical moment, and it’s assigned in a history
course concerned mainly with the cultural
construction of modern America. In this context, the
book is providing background to the discussion, not
presenting arguments, and thus it falls clearly onto
the second rung of our importance hierarchy. This is
not, however, always true with fiction. Novels can
also be used as vehicles for powerful cultural
statements or explorations into why certain events
transpired. In these cases, the fiction becomes a
favored source, or, at the very least, it moves to the
top of our supplemental hierarchy. For example, in a
political science course dealing with totalitarianism
in the twentieth century, George Orwell’s 1984 is not
a source of background, nor does it simply
contextualize a historical moment; it instead
presents an important argument on the subject.
Keep this in mind when selecting your reading.
Fiction should not, by any means, be automatically
discounted. And if you are in an English class that
focuses only on fiction, then obviously fiction
readings are your favored sources. As Christine
from Harvard explains, in these instances, “you
defeat the entire point of the class if you read
summaries or skim…you just have to do the
reading.”

> **Example #2**

Here’s a slightly more challenging example that
comes from the syllabus of a political science course
titled Comparative Health Policy.

***

> **Lecture #4—The Quest for National Health Insurance: Clinton Health Care Plan**

> **Reading:**

> Enthoven, Alain. “Managed Competition: An
> Agenda for Action,” *Health Affairs* 7, no. 3
> (Summer 1988): 25–47.
> 
> Eckholm, Erik. (1993) “Introduction,” in *The
> President’s Health Security Plan*. New York:
> Times Books, vii–xvi. ISBN: 0812923863.
> 
> Skocpol, Theda. “The Rise and Demise of the
> Clinton Health Plan,” in *Health Affairs* 14, no. 1
> (Spring 1995): 66–85.
> 
> Heclo, Hugh. “The Clinton Health Plan:
> Historical Perspective,” in *Health Affairs* 14, no.
> 1 (Spring 1995): 86–98.
> 
> Peterson, Mark A. (1998) “The Politics of Health
> Care Policy: Overreaching in an Age of
> Polarization,” in Margaret Weir, ed., *The Social
> Divide*. Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution
> Press, 181–229.

***

What makes this example hard is that the course
has no obvious favored sources. That is, there is no
textbook or reader that shows up for every class. The
key, in this situation, is to use the lecture title as a
clue. The rule can be simply stated as follows: **In a
course with no favored sources, readings that
directly address the specific topic of the lecture
act as the favored sources for the day.** Treat the
rest as supplemental.

In this example, the lecture is titled The Quest for
National Health Insurance: Clinton Health Care Plan.
Therefore, the Erik Eckholm, Hugh Heclo, and Theda
Skocpol assignments should become your favored
sources, since all three deal directly with the Clinton
health care agenda. You should read these carefully.

The two other articles are supplemental. Because
they look like they contain arguments relevant to the
topic of health care under Clinton, they fall at the top
of our supplemental reading importance hierarchy,
and, therefore, they demand enough attention to
reveal their argument. A smart approach would be to
read the introductions to both of these articles, and
then take careful notes on their theses.

> **Confirming Your Decisions**

You should always use the lecture itself to confirm
your choice about what to read and what to skip. If
the professor emphasizes the importance of a work
that you dismissed (which will happen occasionally
—this system isn’t perfect), then make a note that
you will need to go back and cover this reading in
more detail before the next exam. A smart technique
is to simply write these skipped readings right onto
your syllabus as an assignment for a later class.
Choose a day with a light reading load, and treat the
assignment as if it was given to you by your
professor. If you don’t explicitly schedule a time to
cover this material, you will invariably procrastinate
and then find yourself with a huge reading list to
cover right before the exam.

On the other hand, if you find your professor is
discussing certain assignments in a lot of detail, then
use this input to scale back how closely you are
reading at home. As Lydia from Dartmouth explains:
“If you pay close attention in class and take good
notes, much of the reading is often unnecessary.”

**Take Smart Notes on Your Favored Reading Assignments**

We’ve discussed which readings to ignore or skim.
But the logical next question is what to do with the
favored sources that you decide to read carefully. In
this situation, how you take notes on the reading
makes a big difference. If you write down very little,
the assignment can be completed fast, but the time
will be wasted because you won’t have bothered to
extract the big ideas in a way that makes them
accessible when it comes time to study. If, on the
other hand, you take detailed notes on every
paragraph, your assignments will take way too long
to complete. The best compromise is to use a
strategy similar to the one outlined earlier for taking
lecture notes.

To refresh your memory, the core of this strategy
is that all big ideas can be reduced to a *question*,
*evidence*, and *conclusion*. This approach can work
wonderfully for reading assignments as well. Apply it
as follows:

First, as with lectures, try to take notes on your
computer. They will be more organized and easier to
follow later on, when you use them for review. In
addition, typing makes it easier to record more and
finish faster. Next, carefully read the beginning of the
assignment. Look for the question being answered
by the author. Note that this is different than a thesis
statement. For example, “Why did the Clinton health
care plan fail?” is a question. “The Clinton health
care plan failed because of resistance from
commercial health care providers” is a thesis. In a
reading assignment, the question can usually be
found in the title or perhaps explained in the first few
sentences. Record this in your notes, and label it
clearly.

Next, look for the author’s conclusion (the thesis
statement). This is perhaps the most difficult part,
since academics are known to propose complicated
answers to their questions, especially when writing.
So it may take some serious consideration to figure
out what’s being suggested. Search the first few
paragraphs; this is typically where the conclusion is
hidden. Also check the final few paragraphs. Often a
thesis is proposed at the beginning of an article but
then refined slightly at the end once all of the
supporting evidence has been presented. When you
feel confident in your understanding of the
conclusion, record it carefully in your notes. Don’t
worry if it takes several sentences to capture the
point—err on the side of being thorough.

Now comes the easy part: Skim the entire
reading. Don’t take notes yet. Instead, use a pencil
to make checkmarks next to important paragraphs
that jump out at you. Because you are reading fast,
you may miss some points—don’t worry. “Just get
the gist of the author’s message and how he is
supporting that message with evidence, then move
on,” explains Jason, a straight-A student from the
University of Pennsylvania. You don’t need to
capture everything. Your goal is simply to mark a few
solid examples that justify the conclusion as the
answer to the question.

Once you have skimmed through the entire
reading, go back and find your check marks. For
each mark, record in your notes a concise summary
of the corresponding point. Label each point in your
notes with the page number where you found it. This
shouldn’t take long. Don’t worry about being formal
or grammatically correct. Just dump these pieces of
evidence into your notes. When you’re done, your
notes should contain a clearly labeled question
followed by a half-dozen or so bullet-pointed pieces
of evidence, then a clearly labeled conclusion.

And that’s it! A typical article or book chapter
should fill, at most, a page of single-spaced notes
and take no longer than twenty to thirty minutes to
complete. If it takes you longer, then you’re likely
reading too slowly when you make your check
marks. Don’t be afraid to move quickly—if you
understand the question and the conclusion, all you
need is a sampling of the evidence that connects the
two. As Matthew from Brown puts it, your goal should
be to “read for arguments, not facts.”

**Don’t Work Alone on Problem Sets**

Perhaps the most important rule for taming the
problem sets assigned in technical courses is to
follow our earlier rule and work on them constantly.
As Ryan, a straight-A student from Dartmouth,
explains: “You can work on problem sets in small
pieces while you’re between classes or activities.”
Concentrating on only one or two problems a day will
help you avoid mental fatigue. Once your brain gets
tired, it’s easy to stall—but if you spread out your
work, you will end up spending fewer hours on the
assignment than if you tried to do it all at once.

Even with a smart schedule, however, you will
probably still get stuck occasionally. When this
happens, use all the available resources to help you
get unstuck. If you’re allowed to collaborate with your
classmates, which is often the case in technical
courses, definitely take advantage of this
opportunity. As Greta from Dartmouth explains,
working in groups “can drastically cut the time
required to finish a really hard problem set.” Identify
one or two students who share a similar skill level as
you and then construct a regular schedule for
working together on the class assignments. Set your
meeting dates for two or three days before the
deadlines; this gives you time to first try the
problems on your own and identify the ones that give
you the most trouble. Then, when you meet with your
problem set group, your energy will be focused
where it’s needed most. However, don’t meet the
day before your deadline. It’s important to have at
least one day before handing in the assignment so
you can review all of your answers and fix any small
mistakes.

You should also take advantage of office hours.
Most technical courses hold office hours once a
week, usually run by a teaching assistant (TA).
These meetings are meant to clarify complicated
concepts from class *and* to be a source of help on
hard problems. Always go to office hours, if you have
time, and arrive knowing which homework problems
pose the biggest challenge to you. Don’t be afraid to
ask for help. You will learn a lot during these weekly
sessions, since the TAs will be able to walk you
through the more difficult concepts—which will
ultimately save you a lot of time and frustration.

**Solve Problems on the Go**

Hard problems don’t care about your schedule. If you
set aside a specific hour to work on a problem set,
there is no guarantee that you’ll be able to find the
answers during this time. This is especially true if the
problems you are trying to solve require creative
insight, which can’t be forced. Sitting and staring at a
blank sheet of paper won’t always produce results.

Working with a group can help you bypass these
mental blocks. But often, group work is most useful
when you’ve already thought of potential solutions for
most of the problems. It would be too time
consuming to try to solve *all* of the problems from
scratch with a group. With this in mind, you need a
solid strategy for solving problems on your own
without busting your schedule. A smart technique,
used by many talented technical students, is to solve
problems on the go. Here’s how it works:

First, set aside a little block of time to familiarize
yourself with a couple of problems, and make sure
you understand exactly what is being asked. You
may need to review your notes to refamiliarize
yourself with the relevant concepts.

Next, try to solve the problem in the most obvious
way possible. This, of course, probably won’t work,
because most difficult problems are tricky by nature.
By failing in this initial approach, however, you will
have at least identified *what* makes this problem
hard. Now you are ready to try to come up with a real
solution.

The next step is counterintuitive. After you’ve
primed the problem, put away your notes and move
on to something else. Instead of trying to force a
solution, think about the problem in between other
activities. As you walk across campus, wait in line at
the dining hall, or take a shower, bring up the
problem in your head and start thinking through
solutions. You might even want to go on a quiet hike
or long car ride dedicated entirely to mulling over the
question at hand.

More often than not, after enough mobile
consideration, you will finally stumble across a
solution. Only then should you schedule more time to
go back to the problem set, write it down formally,
and work out the kinks. It’s unclear exactly *why*
solving problems is easier when you’re on the go,
but, whatever the explanation, it has worked for many
students. Even better, it saves a lot of time, since
most of your thinking has been done in little
interludes between other activities, not during big
blocks of valuable free time.

**Write Solutions Right the First Time**

Another important time-saving tip for problem set
work is to record solutions formally the first time you
write them down. Many students first jot down their
answers informally and then return later to reformat
them into something neat enough for submission.
There is no reason to include both steps. You are, for
no good reason, adding a lot of extra time to the
process. Instead, go slowly and deliberately the first
time. Write your answer carefully, and clean it up
immediately until it is of submission quality. Then you
can cross the assignment off your list and it will be
one less thing to worry about.

### Step 3 - Marshal Your Resources

Here’s a surprising fact: Most straight-A students
don’t think “studying” is a big deal. They realize that
the bulk of the work required to ace an exam has
already been accomplished through identifying big
ideas in lectures, extracting arguments from reading
assignments, and solving problem sets. By the time
the test date rolls around, all that’s left is a targeted
review of the ideas that they have already mastered
and internalized. Students who pull sleepless study
marathons, on the other hand, are spending most of
their time trying to learn from scratch the ideas that
they could have been internalizing, bit by bit, as the
term progressed. So forget the conventional wisdom
that more studying equals better grades. Smart
students understand that **if you’re studying hard,
then you’ve done something wrong**. Preparing
for a test should not be painful. And it should not
require a lot of time.

If you have been putting Steps #1 and #2 into
practice, taking smart notes and handling
assignments effectively, studying should not be a big
deal for you either. In fact, when faced with a looming
quiz or exam, you have to do only two things. First,
organize your material intelligently. Second, perform
a targeted review of this material. This section will
teach you how to accomplish the former. Don’t worry
—organizing your material properly is not a difficult
task, but it is important that you do it right. Many
students neglect this step, eager to dive right into the
review, but by doing so they condemn themselves to
hours of unnecessary work. You don’t want to be like
these students. Pay attention to the advice that
follows and you will experience a significant
reduction to the difficulty of your study experience.

**Define the Challenge**

Before you can conduct any meaningful studying, you
must first define the scope of the exam. As Simon
from Brown puts it: “You need to know what kind of
information the professor wants you to know.” To
accomplish this goal, answer the following
questions:

* Which lectures and reading assignments (or
problem sets) are fair game?

* What type of questions will there be, and how
many of each? As Christine from Harvard
explains: “It’s helpful to know in advance what
kind of knowledge will be asked for on the exam
—IDs, dates, broad syntheses of the texts’
major arguments?”

* Is the exam open note or open book?

* For a technical class, will formulas be
provided or do they need to be memorized?

* How much time will be available? Does the
professor expect the exam to be easy to
complete during the test period or a challenge?

Som e professors offer answers to these questions
without being prompted. Many, however, do not. If
it’s two weeks before the exam, and the professor
hasn’t mentioned any details yet, you should ask. If
you’re shy, ask after class. But get the information as
early as possible—it’s crucial to your success.

**Build a Study Guide (*Organizing
Nontechnical Course Material*)**

“I have always been a big fan of making a study
guide,” admits Ryan from Dartmouth. This is a
technique that popped up again and again in my
straight-A interviews. Each student, of course, had
his or her own variation on study guide creation, but
they all followed, more or less, this same general
approach:

For a nontechnical course, once you find out which
lectures and reading assignments are fair game for
the exam, print out the corresponding notes that
you’ve typed up or gather the pages you’ve written
on (don’t be afraid to deconstruct your notebook).
Cluster these pages into piles, separated by general
topic. Clearly label each of these piles with its topic
and fasten them together with a paper clip so you
can easily transport them without mixing up the
pages. This final step is important, since you will be
moving to and from your various isolated study
spaces once you begin your review. For simplicity,
we will refer to these topic-themed piles as
“chapters.” Your final study guide, therefore, should
contain a chapter, consisting of reading and lecture
notes, for each general topic that might be covered
on the exam.

**Construct a Mega-Problem Set
(*Organizing Technical Course Material*)**

For a technical course, many students follow a
variant of the study guide approach that focuses on
sample problems. It works as follows:

Your problem set assignments are the key to your
review process. Start a pile for each problem set
that covers material that might appear on the exam.
Next, you’ll need to supplement each problem set
with sample problems from your lecture notes. For
each lecture relevant to the upcoming exam, do the
following:

1. Match the lecture to the problem set that
covers the same material.

2. Copy sample problems from these lecture
notes onto a blank sheet of paper. You don’t
have to copy the steps or the answers, just the
questions.

3. Label the blank sheet of paper with the date
of the lecture. This will help you later figure out
where these problems came from (and more
important, where their answers can be found).

4. Fasten this sheet with a paper clip to the
problem set you matched it to in step one.

In oth er words, this process transforms your problem
sets into *mega-problem* sets by adding extra
problems drawn from your lecture notes. Pretty
simple.

Finally, you must augment your mega-problem
sets with *technical explanation questions*. What are
these? For every major topic covered in a particular
mega-problem set, jot down a question that asks you
to explain the basics of the topic. For example, as
Greta from Dartmouth recounts, in an “economics
course, I would make study sheets and then add a
general question such as: *what happens when a
government increases spending and lowers
interest rates?*” Or, for a chemistry class, you might
have a problem set containing many questions that
require you to draw the molecular structure of
specific chemical compounds. In this case, you
could add a technical explanation question along the
lines of: “Explain the general procedure for drawing
a molecular structure, why this is useful, and what
special cases must be kept in mind.”

It’s important that you add these technical
explanation questions in addition to your regular
sample problems, since they will reveal whether or
not you understand the underlying concepts or if
you’ve just memorized the steps for some particular
problems.

One last note: If your professor makes a practice
exam available, then print out a copy of it and store it
with your mega-problem sets. For technical courses,
sample exams are a great review tool, and you will
definitely want to have them handy when it comes
time to study.

**Prepare Memorization Aids**

Both technical and nontechnical courses sometimes
require you to do some memorization—formulas,
chemical equations, artwork, dates, or chronologies
—and the most efficient way to memorize this
information is by using flash cards. Almost every
straight-A student interviewed for this book used
flash cards to help with rote memorization.
Fortunately, this technique is easy. Buy a stack of
index cards, put the prompt on one side and the
answer on the other. Constructing these flash cards,
however, can take longer than you might imagine, so
start early. If possible, start writing up your cards at
least a week before the first day you plan to actually
study. The activity is mindless—you can write flash
cards while watching TV—so it shouldn’t be too hard
to get them done, in advance, bit by bit.

**Schedule Your Organization Wisely**

Don’t try to organize and study in the same day. This
is a crucial tactic used by many straight-A students.
When you review, you want your brain at full power. If
you organize your materials the same day that you
review them, your brain will be too tired to
accomplish both effectively. So keep these two
tasks separate and you’ll end up working more
effectively, which reduces the total time spent and
produces better results.

### Step 4 - Conquer the Material

Now it’s time to get down to business. For weeks,
you’ve taken smart notes and extracted insights from
your assignments. You’ve identified the scope of the
exam and organized all the relevant information into
study guides or mega-problem sets. Your flash cards
are stacked and ready to go. You’re rested. Your
time has come. There is nothing left to do but, dare
we say it, *study*.

This is the step students most commonly identify
with exam preparation. It’s also the step that most
students misguidedly spend the majority of their time
on. You’re not most students—at least not anymore.
All of the work you put in up to this point was meant
to make this one step as small and painless and
insignificant as possible. So don’t worry. There are
no all-nighters in your future.

What follows are powerful techniques for taking
your imposing piles of study material and imprinting
the key ideas on your mind as efficiently as possible.
These techniques are quick but ruthlessly effective.
Use them with confidence. They get the job done,
and they get it done fast.

**Trust the Quiz-and-Recall Method**

Whether it’s philosophy or calculus, the most
effective way to imprint a concept is to first review it
and then try to explain it, unaided, in your own words.
If you can close your eyes and articulate an argument
from scratch, or stare at a blank sheet of paper and
reproduce a solution without a mistake, then you
have fully imprinted that concept. It’s not going
anywhere.

The same is *not* true if you merely read over
something. Passively reviewing a concept is not the
same as actively producing it. Most students make
the mistake of relying only on passive review; they
read and reread their notes and assignments, and
assume that the more they read, the more they will
remember. But as Ryan from Dartmouth warns:
“Simply reading it over doesn’t work. You have to
make the extra effort to get it into your head.”

**Using the Quiz-and-Recall Method for
Nontechnical Courses**

To apply the quiz-and-recall method to nontechnical
course material, you first need to construct a
practice quiz for each chapter in your study guide.
Fortunately, the questions for these quizzes already
exist, since, if you’ve followed the advice of Steps #1
and #2, all of your notes should be in a
question/evidence/conclusion format. Therefore, the
quiz for any given chapter can simply contain all of
the questions from the notes you took for that
chapter. You can be flexible here. If your notes
contain some really broad questions—for example,
an entire lecture that deals with only one idea—
break them up into several smaller questions that,
together, cover all of the relevant points. On the other
hand, if your notes have a bunch of really small
questions, you can combine some into larger
questions to save space and time. This process is
not an exact science; your goal is simply to produce
practice quizzes that cover all the material contained
in each corresponding chapter. If you can answer all
the questions, then you understand all the big ideas.

Once you’ve built your practice quizzes, go
through them one by one. For each question, try to
articulate the matching conclusion and provide some
highlights from the supporting evidence. You don’t
have to reproduce the material in your notes word for
word, but you do need a reasonable summary of the
big idea and its support.

Here’s the important part: ***Don’t do this only in
your head!*** If you’re in a private location, say your
answers out loud using complete sentences. As
Lydia from Dartmouth explains: “I find that walking
around and saying things out loud commits them to
memory in a spectacular way.” If it helps, act as if
you’re giving a lecture on the subject. Follow Lydia’s
suggestion and pace around while providing your
answer. Get your blood pumping. Put some music
on in the background. Make it an event. Your study
guide was designed to be portable, so it shouldn’t
be too difficult to find a place to be alone. For this
crucial step, think beyond the library. I used to do this
type of review while walking a nature trail on
campus. One of the students I interviewed reviews
on the treadmill. Be creative. Studying doesn’t have
to involve long hours sitting at a desk.

However, if you are forced to review with other
people around and you need to be quiet, then you
can write out your answers. “The physical act of
writing and the manipulation of the material in my
mind was usually enough to keep things straight,”
explains Melanie, a straight-A Dartmouth student.
You don’t have to format these responses perfectly
with correct spelling and grammar, but they must
contain all of the pertinent information. No shortcuts.
If you don’t say or write it, don’t consider it fully
reviewed.

Next, put little check marks on your quizzes next to
any questions that you had trouble answering.
Glance through your study guide to remind yourself
of the right answers to these questions. Take a quick
break.

Now, repeat the first step, except this time you
need to answer only the questions that you marked
during your first run-through. Put a new check mark
next to the questions that you still have trouble with.
Once again, look through your notes to get the right
answers, and then take a quick break. Then go back
to the practice quiz and try to answer the questions
that you marked on your second run-through. You get
the idea.

Repeat this pattern until you complete a runthrough
without adding any new check marks. At this
point, you’re done!

The power of this approach is its efficiency. You
spend the least amount of time with the questions
that you understand the best, and you spend the
most amount of time with the questions that cause
you the most trouble. You also have a definite
endpoint. There is no need to wonder how much
longer you should continue reviewing. Once you
finish a round without any more check marks, you’re
finished, and not a minute is wasted.

Many students are uneasy with how little time is
required by this process. They feel like they should
continue to review their quizzes, again and again, up
until the moment of the exam. This is unnecessary!
The quiz-and-recall method is powerful because it
does not depend on multiple reviews of the same
information. Once you’ve articulated an answer out
loud in complete sentences, or recorded it clearly
with pencil and paper, it will stick in your mind. As
Chris from Dartmouth explains: “[The quiz-and-recall
method] takes much less time than people think it
does—one day to make the quizzes for the term,
and only a few hours to review.”

**Using the Quiz-and-Recall Method for
Technical Courses**

The quiz-and-recall method is easily applied to
technical courses. You already constructed your
mega-problem sets; now you simply need to solve
them. Start with the technical explanation questions
—thinking about the general concepts first will make
it easier to solve the specific sample problems that
follow. As with nontechnical courses, try to provide
an articulate answer for each problem, and if
possible, give your explanation out loud, as if
lecturing to a class. Otherwise, write out your
answers clearly. Don’t skip any important details.

Once you’re done with the technical explanation
questions, move on to the sample problems. Try to
answer each. Again, ***don’t do this in your head.*** “I
don’t just read the material,” explains Worasom, a
straight-A student from Brown. “I write the important
equations and concepts out by hand.” Your solutions
don’t need to be as detailed as if this was a real
assignment, but they should clearly demonstrate that
you know what you’re doing. If you can’t explain
exactly how you got from the question to the answer,
then you don’t yet understand this problem. Be
honest with yourself: If you’re just regurgitating
memorized solutions, you aren’t prepared to handle
new questions on a test.

As before, check mark the questions that give you
trouble. Review the solutions for these questions.
Take a break. Then repeat the process, except this
time try to answer only the questions you marked on
the previous pass. Follow this method until you finish
a round with no checked problems. When this
happens, you’re done.

Doris from Harvard explains a final caveat for
technical course preparation: “If professors make
exams from past years available, these are a terrific
resource.” In this case, wait until after you finish your
quiz-and-recall, and then try to complete the exam
under timed test-taking conditions. Consider this a
final check that you understand all of the needed
concepts. If you have trouble with a few questions on
this practice exam, review them carefully. If you have
trouble with a lot of questions on this practice exam,
then something went wrong with your previous
review, and you need to go back through the
material. Work through another round of question
answering, and this time really make sure you
understand each of the steps. If you still have trouble,
then it’s time to seek out help from a classmate or a
TA.

**Memorize over Time**

If you have material that must be truly memorized—
dates, artists, chronologies, formulas—there are,
unfortunately, no real shortcuts. You just have to keep
working with your flash cards until you have no
trouble providing the right answer, even after you
shuffle the cards into a random order.

Memorization is particularly dependent on your
available mental energy. It doesn’t work if you try to
commit items to memory for eight hours straight, but
it does work if you memorize only an hour at a time
and only one or two hours a day. So separate the
task of memorizing from your other review. Spread
the work out over many days, and never dedicate too
much time to any one sitting with your flash cards.
Melanie from Dartmouth recalls how some of her
peers would “review their flash cards at any
opportunity—eating dinner, waiting in line at an email
terminal,” which is the most effective way to get
through this tedious task and commit the necessary
items to memory.

### Step 5 - Invest in “Academic Disaster Insurance”

Most college students have an exam horror story to
tell. These stories always seem to start the same
way. The first question on the test is easily solved,
you still have plenty of time, and everything feels
good. Then you see it—a question that you have no
idea how to answer. Leaving it blank will torpedo
your grade, and as you sit and stare, the time to
solve the other questions quietly slips away. The
good feeling is gone, and in its place, panic creeps
in. You’ve just experienced an academic disaster.

Conventional wisdom says that academic
disasters are unavoidable. No one can study every
single topic, and therefore you are going to get
nailed occasionally. But here’s the lesson of Step
\#5: *Don’t believe this.*

Straight-A students have a knack for avoiding
rogue questions. It’s as if they invest in some sort of
academic disaster insurance: protection against the
unexpected return of those obscure topics that slip
by when you doze off for a moment in class. In reality,
this insurance policy is nothing more than a simple
strategy: *Eliminate your question marks.* This
technique can be employed throughout the term and,
over time, significantly reduce the chance that you
will be baffled by an unexpected exam question.

**Eliminate Your Question Marks**

In Step #1, we covered smart techniques for taking
notes in class. If you remember, this strategy
suggests that you put a question mark in your notes
for any topic that flies by without you really
understanding the conclusion. This will occur
occasionally in both technical and nontechnical
courses—sometimes as the result of your attention
wandering and sometimes as the result of the
professor heading off on a tangent and not offering a
satisfactory explanation.

These question marks are dangerous. As
Christine from Harvard puts it, by skipping a point
made in a lecture, “you’re gambling with the
possibility of being truly in the dark on the exam.”
The scenario is simple. During the semester a few
topics slip past your attention in class, so you end up
with a handful of question marks in your notes. When
it comes time to study, you have more than enough
big ideas that you do understand, and that you need
to review, so the occasional question-marked topic
gets ignored. You enter the exam feeling prepared,
and then, as luck would have it, you find yourself
face-to-face with a big essay question covering one
of those bypassed concepts. *Whoops.*

To prevent this from happening, you need to
eliminate these question marks. **The key is to start
this process well before the exam.** If you leave all
of these question marks unanswered until you start
studying, you will end up spending many extra hours
looking up the required explanations. Learning a
large quantity of material from scratch during the
review process is a mistake made by average
students—and you should avoid this.

Instead, try to knock off question marks as soon
as they arrive. By the time you begin studying you
should, as Robert, a straight-A student from Brown,
explains, “have at least a vague understanding of
every topic that will be covered on the exam.” The
following four tactics, if used regularly, will help you
achieve this goal. They provide a solid defense
against unclear ideas and will allow you to start the
study process with an explanation in mind for all
relevant topics.

* Ask questions during class.

“When in doubt, I just ask questions in class for
more clarification,” explains Worasom from
Brown. If a topic slides by you, raise your hand
and ask for a clarification. The more question
marks you eliminate on the spot, the less work
you will have to do later.

* Develop the habit of talking to your
professor briefly after class.

“Talk to the professor after class, or send him
an e-mail asking for clarification about
questions that arose during his lecture,”
suggests Jason from Penn. There is nothing
unusual about this. Most professors will stick
around for five or ten minutes after the bell to
answer final questions. Take advantage of this
time. When the class ends, head over to the
professor and see how many of the question
marks of the day you can get eliminated. You
should then immediately correct your notes
before you forget the explanations. Will this turn
you into a brownnoser? *No!* The brownnosers
are those who come up to the professor only to
tell him what parts of the lecture they found
interesting, or to offer up some of their own
“brilliant” thoughts on the topic. You, on the other
hand, have a list of focused questions that you
want answered, which makes you seem smart,
not sniveling.

* Ask classmates.

If you’re still unclear, James, a straight-A student
from Dartmouth, recommends that you “talk with
other people about the topic.” Send an e-mail or
corner them in the hall soon after the lecture. If
they understand the topic, it will take them only a
few minutes to explain it to you while it’s still
fresh in their minds.

* Come prepared to exam review sessions
(if offered).

Many classes offer a formal review session the
week before the exam. Go to these. Before you
arrive, jot down all of the topics from your notes
that you are still unsure about. Then, during the
session, try to get all of them answered. Don’t
be worried about having a lot to discuss. More
often than not, review sessions suffer from too
few student questions, so your professor or TA
will appreciate your preparation.

The goal of these defensive tactics is to eliminate
your question marks without adding any study time.
If, however, despite your best attempts, some of
these unclear topics persist until your review, your
last-ditch defense is to skim. You probably won’t
have time at this point to look up detailed
explanations from scratch for every leftover question
mark. And, even if you did, the effort would be way
too time consuming (remember: Straight-A students
avoid long study hours), so skim over just enough
material to have *something* to say for each of these
points. On the off chance that one of these lingering
question-marked topics comes up on the exam, at
least you won’t leave a blank page. But this situation
can still be dangerous, so follow the first four
strategies to reduce the topics you don’t understand
as much as possible before your studying begins.

### Step 6 - Provide “A+” Answers

The final step of the straight-A process is actually
taking the test. Many students incorrectly believe that
preparation is the only thing that counts. To them,
taking a test is a simple matter of showing off what
they know. This type of thinking is risky. Why? *Even
the most prepared student can bomb an exam due
to poor test-taking skills.*

The potential pitfalls during an exam are
numerous, but the most common are: (1) running out
of time and (2) providing answers that, although
detailed, don’t fully answer all parts of the question
being asked. In fact, these two dangers work
together in a devilish counterbalance, making them
particularly hard to conquer. That is, if you try to
avoid spending too much time on questions, then
you are likely to provide incomplete answers. On the
other hand, if you try to provide detailed answers,
then you are likely to run out of time.

The situation sounds dire, but it’s not. With the
right strategy, you can eliminate these fears and
ensure that your grade properly reflects your level of
preparation. Straight-A students recognize this point,
and when asked about test-taking, they provided
detailed responses, proving that for them, this final
step is no mere afterthought. They treat the testtaking
process with great respect, and this attention
is reflected in their consistently high grades.

Their advice has been culled into five key
strategies. Together, they provide a comprehensive
test-taking system, finely tuned through experience
to maximize performance. Follow these rules on
every exam, and you’ll be able to transform yourself
into a test-taking machine—cool, confident, and
ruthlessly efficient as you move from question to
question, providing the best possible answers.

**Strategy #1: Review First, Answer
Questions Later**

“I always read through the entire exam first,” explains
Robert from Brown. This is good advice—for any
exam, your first step should always be to review all of
the questions. If it’s an essay exam or a technical
exam with a relatively small number of questions,
then read each prompt carefully. If the exam is
multiple choice or contains many questions, skim
through quickly and get a feel for which topics are
covered.

This review familiarizes you with the length and
relative difficulty of what lies ahead. It also primes
your brain for the topics you’ll need to address.
“Always scan all the questions,” explains Anna from
Dartmouth. “This allows your mind to think about all
of them, even while you are focusing on one in
particular.” In other words, while you toil away on an
early question, another part of your brain, working in
the background, will begin to retrieve information
relating to the topics still to come. This actually
happens, and it helps you answer the later questions
more quickly.

Finally, and perhaps most significantly, this first
step also helps you relax. Stress proliferates in a
classroom right before an exam is distributed. It’s a
make-or-break situation. Months of effort have led up
to this single moment, and you have only a scant
hour or two to prove what you know and secure your
final grade. You begin to question yourself. Did you
study everything you needed to? Have you forgotten
important ideas? What if the exam focuses on a
subject you know nothing about? If you left it blank,
what would happen then? Just thinking about this
situation is enough to make most undergrads sweat.

However, by taking the first few minutes to
carefully review the exam, you break this mounting
tension. It gives you something productive to do that
doesn’t involve actually answering questions. Once
you complete this task and build a better idea of
what to expect, the exam becomes less menacing.
You’ve seen the questions, and (hopefully) none
seem impossible. You begin to say to yourself:
*Okay, maybe this isn’t all that bad.* Your confidence
rises, your heart rate lowers, and your stress begins
to dissipate. Now you can turn your full attention to
providing standout responses.

**Strategy #2: Build a Time Budget**

At any given point during an exam, you should know
the maximum number of minutes you have to spend
on the current question before moving on to the next.
As Doris from Harvard puts it: “I lay down very strict
time limits for myself on each question.” This
strategy goes a long way toward avoiding time
trouble; it keeps your attention focused and prevents
you from spending too much time on any particular
question.

The key to maintaining this keen awareness is to
build a time budget. First, take the time allotted for
the exam and subtract ten minutes. Next, divide this
amount by the number of questions. The result is
how long you have to spend on each prompt.

What should you do with this information? For an
exam with a small number of questions, mark right
on the test pages the time when you should begin
and finish each one. For an exam with many
questions, divide the exam into equal fourths, then jot
down the time you should begin and end each
section. In both cases, these recorded times will
keep you updated on how close your current
progress matches your predetermined schedule.

Why do we subtract ten minutes in the first step?
This provides a safety buffer. You want a few extra
minutes available here and there to be able to
double check your answers when you are finished, or
go back and add more insights to questions on
which you were rushed.

**Strategy #3: Proceed from Easy to Hard**

Straight-A students almost never answer exam
questions in the order that they are presented. Years
of informal experimentation by successful students
have demonstrated that the most effective way to
tackle an exam is to answer the easiest questions
first, and this is exactly what you should do. Start with
the most approachable questions before moving on
to the more forbidding. Don’t worry if this has you
skipping around all over the exam—in most cases
the provided order is irrelevant.

The advantage of this approach is that it first
focuses your energy on the questions you know the
most about, ensuring that you get maximum points
on these. It also gives you a better chance of
conquering the more difficult ones. “I always skip a
question if it does not come to me immediately,”
explains Ryan from Dartmouth. “This keeps my mind
clear to answer other questions and hopefully
something will jog my memory.”

When you come across something hard early on
in the exam, your natural instinct is to panic. You
have so many more questions to finish, and you can
almost feel the minutes ticking away as you stare
blankly at this one particular roadblock. It can be
tough to get your focus back to wring out as many
points as possible from the easier questions that
follow.

If, instead, you tackle this same roadblock at the
end of the exam, you’ll find that the situation seems
less dire. You’ve answered everything else, so all
that’s left to do is working out this final puzzler. More
often than not, you will find the mental block
diminished. Without the pressure of other questions
looming in the background, you can take a more
relaxed approach. You might not know the *best*
answer, but you can spend some time to devise a
*reasonable* answer. Because you have nothing else
left to finish, you can spend the remainder of the time
polishing this answer, thinking, and repolishing. The
result is the strongest possible outcome given your
state of preparation.

**Strategy #4: Outline Essays**

When facing an essay question, don’t just start
writing and see what happens. This approach leads
to rambling answers and missed concepts. Instead,
your first step should be to jot down a quick outline.
This might seem like a waste of time, but in truth it
can be invaluable.

First, reread the question carefully. As Matthew
from Brown explains: “Usually, you can isolate three
or four mini-questions from a single essay question.”
Underline each of these mini-questions; this will help
you flesh out your outline and avoid an incomplete
answer. “Then, outline on paper (not in your head)
the way that you will use what you know to answer
these mini-questions,” continues Matthew. To do so,
use the margin of the exam to jot down all of the
points you can recall that are relevant to the
question. Record only a few key words for each point
to save time and space. For example, if you want to
mention an argument made by an author named
Robert Caro dealing with Lyndon Johnson’s views
on race relations, you might jot down: “Caro—race.”

Next, go back and check the question parts you
underlined in the first step. Make sure each is
adequately addressed by the points you just noted in
the margin. When you’re sure that you have
identified all the relevant information for the essay,
number these points in the order that you want to
present them.

Only now should you begin writing your essay.
Follow your outline, and the writing will proceed
smoothly. You should be able to quickly produce a
solid response that draws on everything you
reviewed and addresses all parts of the question
asked.

**Strategy #5: Check Your Work**

“At the end,” explains Chris from Dartmouth, “I
always check my answers.” If you have extra time at
the end of the exam (may you be so lucky), then
follow Chris’s advice and go back and check your
work. You will be surprised by how many times this
final review turns up a mistake in a technical problem
or an important concept that you forgot to mention in
an essay.

If, after your first round of review, you still have time
left over, then go through and check again. If there is
a problem you feel particularly shaky on, use this
time to go over it in detail, augmenting the answer
wherever appropriate. Don’t worry about using
carets and arrows to add in new phrases and facts
to your essays, or to point out added steps in your
technical problems. Neatness doesn’t count on
exams; it’s the content that matters.

It’s tempting to relax after finishing your exam,
perhaps walking proudly to the front of the classroom
and handing it in before anyone else. But aside from
the wistful stares of your classmates, this strategy is
ill conceived. Double checking your work up to the
last minute can make the difference between an
above-average student and an academic star.

> **The Plan in Action**

Now let’s look at how the steps for Part Two play out
in the real world. This section presents two realistic
case studies, both demonstrating how a hypothetical
student uses straight-A strategies to prepare for an
exam. You’ll notice that each student has a couple of
curveballs thrown into the mix. For example, Julie
has a big paper due the same Monday as her
midterm, so she can’t simply cram all weekend. And
Michael doesn’t even start his review until a couple
of days before the exam.

The key here is to notice the flexibility with which
these students apply the advice. This underscores
the main lesson of these case studies: *A study
system is only as useful as your ability to adapt it to
your unique situation.* Both of our students manage
to fit their review into an already busy schedule and
do so without ever cramming, pulling all-nighters, or
even spending more than a few hours studying on
any given day.

**Case Study #1—Julie’s History Midterm**

The final grade for Julie’s history class is based only
on a midterm, a final, and one paper. Therefore, her
performance on this upcoming midterm is important.
The following timeline of Julie’s preparation will give
you a feel for how she spreads out the necessary
work for optimal results.

> **Monday—Two Weeks Before the Midterm**

At the beginning of class, the professor issues a
quick reminder about the upcoming exam. Taking
advantage of the situation, Julie raises her hand to
ask what it will cover and in what format. The
professor offers the following information:

* The exam will consist mainly of essay
questions. The topics will be broad, but the
student will need to draw support from the
reading assignments.

* There will also be a timeline section that will
present a group of historical events covered in
the class and then ask the student to rearrange
them into chronological order.

Now that Julie has a better feel for what to expect,
she can construct a rough study schedule. Her
biggest problem is that she has a big paper due for
another class on the same day as the midterm! This
prevents her from using the weekend before the
exam as a big cram session (the strategy used by
most students). She’s going have to figure out a way
to tackle her preparation in advance.

Julie decides that she will start her review this
upcoming weekend (a little more than a week before
the exam). Specifically, she will use this weekend to
organize the necessary materials, which shouldn’t
take long. She will then use the week that follows to
actually do the review, spreading the work out into
little chunks so she won’t get behind in her other
obligations. That’s all the time that she can spare. In
particular, notice that she hasn’t scheduled any
studying for the Saturday and Sunday right before
the big exam—she expects this time to be
consumed with paper writing.

To implement this plan, she follows the advice of
Part One and records the details on her calendar,
writing on each day what work she should
accomplish. This will save her a lot of stress—most
students spend the week or so before an exam
constantly worried about whether they should be
studying and whether they have enough time left to
prepare. Julie, on the other hand, is free from these
worries. All she has to do is look at her calendar
each morning and schedule a time for whatever
piece of the study process she finds recorded for the
day.

> **Saturday—Nine Days Before the Midterm**

Julie’s busy. As on most weekends, she has a lot
of schoolwork to finish for Monday, and she also has
some ambitious social plans for the evening, so her
time is certainly limited.

The goal of this weekend is to organize her history
materials, which thankfully doesn’t demand a lot of
hard thinking. (Julie hopes to get some relaxation
out of her two days off.) She consults her calendar:
Today (Saturday), she should print hard copies of all
the relevant notes and then prepare the
memorization aids for the timeline section.
Tomorrow (Sunday), she will focus her energy on
constructing the practice quizzes for her notes.

First, Julie sets aside an hour before lunch to print
out the lecture and reading notes she made during
the first half of class. She gathers the printouts,
stashes them in a folder, then she heads off to meet
some friends for lunch.

Later that afternoon, she sets aside another half
hour to work on her memorization aids. Fortunately,
all of the major events discussed in the lectures were
also described in the class textbook. Though most of
these events were covered in much more detail in
the other reading assignments, to construct a simple
list of events (and their respective dates) requires
only a quick scan through of this one book. As she
comes across each relevant event, she jots the
name on one side of an index card, and then puts
the date on the other side.

> **Sunday—Eight Days Before the Midterm**

Midmorning, a slightly groggy Julie (it was an
eventful Saturday night) pulls herself out of bed,
snags her laptop, her folder of note printouts, and a
large coffee, and then heads to one of her favorite
secret study spots. Being early on a Sunday (at
least, early relative to the typical college student
schedule), the library is deserted—just the way she
likes it.

Getting down to business, Julie first sorts her
notes into piles by subject. Some notes, of course,
seem to straddle multiple subjects. That’s okay. The
piles are just a rough form of organization. Nothing
has to be exact here. She ends up with six piles,
which together constitute her study guide for the
midterm.

Julie then goes through each printout in her first
pile, typing quiz questions on her laptop as she
proceeds. Sometimes she copies questions straight
off her notes. Other times she puts down a more
general question that covers several smaller points
described in her notes. It doesn’t really matter
exactly how she chooses the quiz questions, just as
long as the questions being typed into her laptop
more or less cover every important point discussed
in the notes. After about an hour and a half, Julie has
finished typing up quizzes for the first three of her six
piles.

She breaks for lunch, then returns later in the
afternoon and spends another two hours
constructing her quizzes. Once she’s done, she
prints out all six and attaches them to their
corresponding piles.

Though Julie’s goal for the day was only to
organize, the very act of constructing these quizzes
has forced her to do a quick review of all the relevant
course material—an important first step in
internalizing all the necessary information.

> **Monday Through Friday—The Week Before the Midterm**

On Monday, as dictated by her calendar, Julie
spends two hours mastering the first two quizzes, a
task she accomplishes by pacing around her dorm
room and lecturing answers to an imaginary class.
(Needless to say, Julie waited for a time when her
roommate was out before starting this vocal review.)
On Tuesday, she works with her memorization flash
cards for forty-five minutes. On Wednesday, she
spends two hours mastering the middle two quizzes.
On Thursday, she spends another hour with her
memorization flash cards. And on Friday, she
spends two hours mastering the final two quizzes.

As one might expect, even though she had
previously eliminated most question marks in her
notes by following the advice of Step #5 (Invest in
Academic Disaster Insurance), Julie comes across
a handful of questions that she still doesn’t really
have a satisfactory answer for. She jots down these
questionable topics, vowing to deal with them later.

> **Saturday—Two Days Before the Midterm**

Julie had hoped to finish studying before this
weekend, but she was busier than she had expected
the previous week, so she still has a little more to
review. Because she also has a paper deadline on
Monday, she knows that, at most, she can spare
maybe an hour today for exam preparation. She
uses this hour to finish her academic disaster
insurance investment; specifically, she takes the list
of questions for which she doesn’t have great
answers and sends e-mails to classmates in hopes
of soliciting better ones.

By the end of the day, she has received
responses, of varying levels of detail, for most of her
outstanding questions. She doesn’t feel great about
her knowledge on these few points, but at least now
she has something to say if it comes down to it.

> **Monday—The Day of the Midterm**

Notice that while most of her classmates
sacrificed the entire weekend studying, Julie did little
more than send a few e-mails over the last couple of
days, leaving her free to focus on her paper. Now
that it’s the day of the midterm, she still doesn’t have
much serious preparation pending. During the
morning, she shuffles through her memorization flash
cards a couple of times and dips into her quizzes at
random, answering a half-dozen questions just to
boost her confidence. She’s rested and ready to go.

Finally, it’s time for the exam, and Julie knows
exactly what to do. First, she zips right to the
chronology section and makes quick work of the
listed events. Her flash cards prepared her well.
Then, she reviews the four essay questions that
follow. She constructs a time budget and tackles the
questions in order of difficulty. Her quizzes set her up
well to provide thorough, standout answers without
too much wasted time thinking about what to say
next. She is able to draw from several sources for
each question, and because the information is so
ingrained in her mind from her earlier quiz-and-recall
sessions, she often finds herself being able to recall
arguments almost word-for-word from her notes. And
because she outlines her essays, she provides
answers that pull in as much relevant information as
possible and cover all pieces of the topic at hand.

> **The Aftermath**

Julie nailed the chronology section and provided
detailed and complete answers to each essay
question. Obviously, she gets an A. And this doesn’t
at all surprise her. Later, when her friends, griping
about their B exams, complain about how they spent
all weekend “studying,” Julie kindly neglects to
mention that she studied a grand total of one hour
over the weekend and no more than a few hours on
any given day before that.

**Case Study #2—Michael’s Calculus Exam**

Michael’s taking a calculus class and, as he’s quick
to admit, he doesn’t like calculus. But, as is the case
at most colleges, a semester of calculus is required,
so Michael’s out of luck. The grade for this particular
course is based on three exams and a bunch of
problem sets. Let’s see how Michael uses our
system to overcome his lack of a natural affinity for
the mathematical arts and pull off a strong grade
without too much suffering.

> **Monday—Four Days Before the First Exam**

Yes, Michael’s first calculus exam is less than a
week away. By this point, as you’ll recall, Julie was
already well along in her preparation. But there are
three things to remember here. One, this exam is not
quite as big and as important as Julie’s midterm. It
covers only a third of the material, and its
contribution to Michael’s final grade is shared with
two other tests and many problem sets. Second,
sometimes (okay, many times) people have been
known to allow exam dates to slip up on them. If you
follow the advice from Part One, this should not
happen to you often. But it’s important to see how
the straight-A system can be adapted and applied
even under these tight constraints. Finally, remember
that Julie’s exam date fell on the same day as a
paper was due, so she had to be more
conscientious with how she spread out her work.

Because math professors tend to be precise,
Michael doesn’t need to ask about what the exam
will cover. This information is spelled out in the
syllabus. Specifically, the exam will draw from all
material covered up until last Friday, which was
when the professor handed back their last problem
set.

As you might imagine, Michael is somewhat
stressed about the proximity of the exam. But this
stress is mitigated significantly by his knowledge of
our system. He knows that his next step is to marshal
his resources, and that is what he is going to do
tonight. Here’s how he proceeds:

The upcoming exam covers the first four weeks of
the course. Because Michael had one problem set
assigned each week, he now has four graded
problem sets to use as the foundations for his megaproblem
sets. His first step is to extract sample
problems from his notes to add to his existing
graded problem sets. Following the strategy of Step
\#3, he grabs a blank sheet of paper for each of the
four weeks of class. He then flips through his
notebook and jots down sample problems from his
notes onto the appropriate week’s sheet of paper.
Note: Michael is careful to label each question with
the date of the lecture where he found it. This will
make it easy to look up the answers in his notebook
when it comes time to review. Finally, he attaches
each sheet to the corresponding problem set.

When he’s done, Michael has four mega-problem
sets, each consisting of one graded problem set
assignment from class, and a sheet of paper filled
with sample problems from his notes.

His final act of organization is to think up some
technical discussion questions. For example, during
the first week, Michael’s class focused on single
variable derivatives, so he jots down the following
general question on his first mega-problem set:
“*Explain what a derivative is, what it describes, and
the general procedure for calculating one when
given a function.*”

Remember, these general explanation questions
are crucial. Without them, you run the danger of
memorizing specific problems but not learning the
technique behind the problems, ill equipping you to
handle the fresh problems you will face on the exam.

Because he only has to cover four weeks of
material, this process only takes about an hour to
complete. Following our prohibition against
organizing and reviewing on the same day, Michael
calls it quits until tomorrow.

> **Tuesday—Three Days Before the Exam**

Michael’s first class is at 11 A.M., so he drags
himself out of bed at 8:30 A.M. to put in two hours of
studying before his day really gets started. This is
especially important because he has a busy
afternoon and evening planned, and he is worried
that he won’t have any other free time to study today.
He also believes in our philosophy of trying to finish
as much work as possible as early as possible, so
this decision comes naturally.

By 9 A.M., Michael has settled into one of his
favorite secluded study spots—a deserted upper
floor of a small engineering library. He has a bowl of
oatmeal in his stomach and a cup of coffee at his
side, so you better believe that he’s ready to work.

It’s time to start the quiz-and-recall process.
Michael tries to provide answers for each of the
questions contained in his first mega-problem set.
He uses a sheet of scratch paper and forces himself
to jot down the important steps to each problem. For
the technical explanation questions, he actually
paces up and down the stacks, lecturing about the
topics under his breath. After his first pass-through
he takes a ten-minute break, then returns to tackle
only the questions that gave him trouble. He
continues until he has successfully answered every
question. Because he is using the quiz-and-recall
method, his focus is directed efficiently. He spends
the most time this morning on the problems with
which he has the most trouble and the least time on
the problems he understands well.

> **Wednesday—Two Days Before the Exam**

The exam looms two days in the future, and
Michael has three more weeks’ worth of material to
master. Realizing the potential urgency of this
situation, he carves out two separate two-hour
chunks of study for the day, giving him four total
hours in which to work. The first chunk is in the
morning, the second in the afternoon. The break in
between will help Michael’s brain recharge and
prevent this task from becoming too mentally
draining.

As before, it takes Michael most of the first two
hours to get through his second mega-problem set.
Once again, several passes were required, each
one focusing on fewer and fewer problems.

That afternoon, Michael knocks off the third megaproblem
set during his second two-hour block. In
fact, because this material is more recent, he is able
to finish in just an hour and a half. Michael doesn’t try
to cram more work into this newly discovered free
time. He has accomplished what he had hoped for
the day.

> **Thursday—One Day Before the Exam**

Michael feels good. Yes, the exam is tomorrow.
But he has already applied the quiz-and-recall
method to three-fourths of the material that he needs
to learn. While many of his classmates have set
aside this entire day (and probably night as well) for
cramming, Michael, on the other hand, once again
schedules only a couple of hours in the morning.

It takes him a little over an hour to complete his
final mega-problem set (this material was covered
just last week in class, so it’s still fresh in his mind),
and with the remaining time he goes through his
notes to retrieve the handful of question-marked
topics that evaded his efforts, as spelled out in Step
#5, to explain them before the study process began.
For each of these questions, Michael reduces his
confusion to a set of concise statements along the
lines of: “*I don’t understand the fourth step in the
following problem from the 9/28/05 lecture notes…*”
He then e-mails a friend in the class (someone who
happens to have more natural math ability than
Michael), asking if he can stop by to talk about the
material. The friend agrees.

That night, Michael stops by his friend’s dorm
room. Not surprisingly, the friend is bleary eyed,
surrounded by piles of notes, and just finishing the
first several hours of what will undoubtedly become a
late-night cram session. They discuss Michael’s
specific questions and clear up most of his
confusion. The friend makes some comments about
how brutal the studying will be, and Michael nods in
agreement—choosing not, for the sake of their
friendship, to mention that he hasn’t even so much
as looked at a calculus textbook since early that
morning and has no intention of looking at one for
the rest of the evening.

> **Friday—Day of the Exam**

If a practice exam had been available, this
morning would be a great time for Michael to tackle
it. Refreshed and prepared, Michael would have
found the experience a confidence booster and a
final check for any techniques he might have missed
in his systematic review.

Because no such practice exam exists, Michael
creates his own. Setting aside forty-five minutes in
the morning for a final review, Michael articulates out
loud the explanations that he learned last night for his
question-marked topics. He then goes back over a
handful of the hardest problems from his megaproblem
sets, solving each one with ease. This
boosts his confidence and puts his mind in the right
state. That’s it. He’s ready to go.

When the big moment arrives, and the exams are
finally handed out, Michael knows exactly how to
proceed. He first sorts the questions in order of
difficulty and then constructs a time budget. He gets
off to a good start, providing solid answers to the
easy problems that he tackles first. Soon he is left
with only a small number of tricky problems and a
solid block of time in which to solve them. He begins
work on the first of these hard prompts but quickly
finds himself stuck. He’s having trouble finding a
solution. Time marches forward. Incipient tinges of
panic begin to nibble at his concentration.

Michael realizes it’s time to step back. He takes a
deep breath. Remembering the test-taking
strategies from Step #6, he skips this problem and
moves on to the next. He is able to get decent
answers for the remaining hard problems. They
aren’t great answers, but they demonstrate his solid
understanding of the underlying techniques. Now,
with only five minutes to spare, Michael returns to his
nemesis. It’s still tricky. He still doesn’t know exactly
how to solve it. But the pressure is much lower now.
Because it’s the only problem left, Michael can rid
his mind of the distraction of other questions. This is
all that remains; even if he completely blanks and
puts down nothing, the only damage done will be
limited to one problem. That’s not so bad.

With the intensity of the situation lessened,
Michael can think more clearly. And, sure enough, he
comes up with an idea of how to proceed. In the few
minutes that remain, he carefully records some
sensible steps toward a solution. It’s by no means a
complete or perfect response, but it’s the best he
can do under the circumstances.

> **The Aftermath**

As is often the case, the problem that gave
Michael so much trouble gave everyone else in the
class trouble as well. Many of these other students,
however, didn’t have the resources to stay cool
under pressure (the resources, of course, being
Michael’s test-taking strategies). Their consternation
regarding this one devilish prompt led them to waste
a lot of time, rush through the final problems, and
make many careless mistakes. Michael, on the other
hand, got credit for all of the problems that he knew
and a good chunk of partial credit for the tricky
problem. Because of the trouble his classmates had
on this exam, his performance, though not perfect,
was near the top of the heap. He receives an A.

The lesson learned here is important. For
technical exams, you can never guess how well you
performed until you get your grade back. Problems
that you couldn’t solve may have stymied everyone
else as well. Therefore, you need to lose the high
school mentality that 90 percent to 100 percent of
the points gets an A, and 80 percent to 89 percent of
the points gets a B, and so forth. In technical
classes, it’s most likely that the professor grades on
a curve, so that the top 15 percent of scores (no
matter how high or low they are) get As, the next 20
percent get Bs, and so on. For example, I’ve taken
more than one technical exam where the average
score was hovering around 50 points out of 100, and
a score of 65 merited an A. I’ve seen exam
questions that not a single person in the class got
right. And I once got an A on an exam where I left a
problem blank that was worth 25 percent of the
points. You never know what’s going to happen.

This all leads to the following point: *Never lose
your cool*. Michael did the right thing by ordering his
problems according to their difficulty and then
skipping past a particularly troubling one when it
appeared. His goal was to get the maximum number
of points possible, not to get every problem right.
And the result was a strong grade.

### Part Two Cheat Sheet

#### Step #1. Take Smart Notes

* Always go to class and try to take the best
notes possible.

* For nontechnical courses, capture the big
ideas by taking notes in the
question/evidence/conclusion format.

* For technical courses, record as many sample
problems and answers as possible.

#### Step #2. Demote Your Assignments

* Work a little bit each day on your assignments;
avoid suffering from day-before syndrome.

* Read only the favored sources on the syllabus
in detail. To decide how much time to spend on
supplemental sources, remember the
importance hierarchy:

  – readings that make an argument are more
important than

  – readings that describe an event or person,
which are more important than

  – readings that only provide context (i.e.,
speech transcripts, press clippings).

* Take reading notes in the
question/evidence/conclusion format.

* Work in groups on problem sets, solve
problems on the go, and write up your answers
formally the first time.

#### Step #3. Marshal Your Resources
* Figure out exactly what the test will cover.

* Cluster your notes for nontechnical courses.

* Build mega-problem sets for technical
courses.

#### Step #4. Conquer the Material

* Embrace the quiz-and-recall method. It’s the
single most efficient way to study.

* Spread out memorization over several days.
Your mind can do only so much at a time.

#### Step #5. Invest in “Academic Disaster
Insurance”

* Eliminate the question marks for topics
covered in class or from the reading that you
don’t understand.

#### Step #6. Provide “A+” Answers

* Look over the whole test first.

* Figure out how much time you have to spend
on each question (leaving a ten-minute cushion
at the end).

* Answer the questions in order of increasing
difficulty.

* Write out a mini-outline before tackling an
essay question.

* Use any and all leftover time to check and
recheck your work.
