**C**ongratulations! You’re about to embark on a new
and exciting chapter in your college experience. It
doesn’t matter if you agree with every piece of
advice you just encountered; what’s important is that
by making it this far, you’ve learned two crucial
insights: (1) Brute force study habits are incredibly
inefficient; and (2) It is possible to come up with
techniques that work much better and require much
less time. With this in mind, you are now prepared to
leap past the majority of your classmates and begin
scoring top grades without sacrificing your health,
happiness, or social life.

I leave you, however, with one last request. Once
you put these ideas into practice and begin to
experience their many benefits, remember what your
academic life was like before your transformation.
Then, the next time you see a poor student huddled
in the library, bleary-eyed after an all-nighter, or
encounter a friend near a nervous breakdown from
the sheer stress of looming deadlines, take him
aside and let him know that it doesn’t have to be this
way. Tell him that studying doesn’t just mean reading
and rereading your notes and assignments as many
times as possible; nor does paper writing
necessitate all-night marathons at the keyboard.
These tasks don’t have to be so draining. They don’t
have to be something you fear. With the right
guidance, a willingness to eschew conventional
wisdom, and a little experimentation, academics can
be transformed into one of the most satisfying and
fulfilling components of your college experience. You
know this now. Share your knowledge.

As our generation finds itself increasingly stressed
and disillusioned with life paths that we feel have
been imposed upon us from the outside, this lesson
takes on a particular importance. By mastering the
skills in this book you are, in effect, taking control of
your own young life. You are declaring to the world
that you’re not at college just because it seemed like
the thing to do; instead, you’re there to master new
areas of knowledge, expand your mental abilities,
and have some fun in the process. You’re also
denying your major or the climate of the job market
the right to dictate what you can or can’t do after
graduation. By scoring exceptional grades, you are
opening the door to many interesting and
competitive opportunities that allow you, and not
anyone else, to make the decision of what postcollege
pursuits will bring you the most fulfillment. In
the end, therefore, this book is about so much more
than just grades; it is about taking responsibility for
your own journey through life. I wish you the best of
luck in this adventure, and hope this advice helps
you to launch an exciting future.
