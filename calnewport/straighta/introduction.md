This is not your average college study guide. Unlike
the titles next to it on the shelf, none of the advice
presented here was devised by professors or selfproclaimed
academic skills experts. I promise that
you won’t find any mention of the Cornell note-taking
method, mental map diagrams, or any other “optimal
learning technique” crafted in an office or laboratory
— environments far removed from the realities of
typical college life.

**Instead, this book reveals—for the first time—
the study habits used by real straight-A college
students.** All of the advice that follows was distilled
from a series of interviews I conducted with a large
group of top-scoring undergraduates. These
participants were drawn predominantly from the Phi
Beta Kappa rolls of some of the country’s most
rigorous colleges and universities—including
Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Dartmouth, Brown,
Columbia, Duke, Amherst, and Skidmore—and they
were carefully chosen to represent a wide variety of
academic concentrations. In each interview, I asked
the student to detail his or her study habits. The
questions ranged from the general (“How do you
defeat the urge to procrastinate?”) to the specific
(“What techniques or systems do you use to locate
and organize sources for a research paper?”). If the
questionnaire revealed the student to be a grind—
someone who earns high grades simply by studying
an excessive amount—I discarded the responses. I
was interested only in students who improved their
grades through smarter, more efficient study skills—
not through longer hours and more painful study
sessions.

How did I know such students existed? *I am one
of them*. When I arrived as a freshman at Dartmouth
College, I had no idea how to prepare for exams or
write college-level papers. Like most students, I left
high school believing that to study meant to reread
your class notes and assignments as many times as
possible and that paper writing required you to sit
down in front of your computer and start typing until
you finished. The problem, however, is that college is
not high school. The material to be mastered is
much more complicated and the professors have
higher expectations. In the college environment,
simple brute force study methods can end up
requiring a lot of time and causing a lot of pain.
Nevertheless, most students still rely on them. And
this is why they find themselves regularly pulling all-
nighters and developing an antagonistic attitude
toward their courses. The taxing effects and spotty
success of these methods also underlie the common
belief that only geniuses and grinds can score top
grades.

When I first entered college, I shared in these
beliefs. But soon I became dubious. It didn’t take
long for me to decide that there had to be a better
way to learn the material. The results of my studying
using simple techniques varied widely—I’d spend all
night hacking away at an essay and end up scoring
a B-, or give what I thought was a frantic last-minute
review for a quiz and score an A. I constantly felt like
I was behind in my reading, and there always
seemed to be new deadlines on the horizon that I
had to scramble to meet. It was truly a chaotic
existence. But when I looked around, all of my friends
seemed to be having the same experience—and
none of them seemed willing to question it. This
didn’t sit right with me. I wasn’t content to work in
long, painful stretches and then earn only slightly
above-average grades for my efforts. I wanted to be
exceptional. And I wanted to achieve this without
having to sacrifice sleep or my social life. To many
students, such a goal may sound hopelessly
hubristic. But I’m an optimist by nature, and,
observing the sorry state of my current study skills, I
was convinced that I could do better.

It took me most of my freshman year to construct,
through repeated experimentation, a toolbox of
sufficiently improved study habits. But once I had
perfected them, the results were profound. Of the
thirty-six courses I took between my sophomore and
senior years of college, I scored exactly one A- and
35 perfect As. The most stunning piece of this
transformation, however, was how much less time I
had to spend on studying. As my strategies became
more refined, the hours required were reduced. By
my senior year it got to the point where, during finals
periods, I would sometimes pretend to be heading
off to the library just so I wouldn’t demoralize my
roommates, who were preparing for yet another grim
all-nighter.

What was my secret? *Efficiency*. The simple truth
is that the brute force techniques used by most
students are incredibly inefficient. When it comes to
exam preparation, passive review is not an effective
way to learn complicated concepts. It’s also mentally
draining, which further diminishes the rate at which
you can absorb and internalize information. For
paper writing, this same problem holds. When you
approach the task without proper preparation, it
becomes incredibly tiring and you can end up
spinning your wheels. After a while, even the
formation of coherent sentences becomes difficult
and time intensive. In contrast, the techniques I came
up with were so streamlined that I could learn more
material than my classmates and actually spend less
time studying. By eliminating stupid habits and
wasted effort, I transformed exam prep and paper
writing from a dreaded chore to a targeted activity.

For a while, I was convinced that I was unique for
having discovered such a smart approach to
learning. But, alas, this illusion was soon shattered. It
occurred during the winter of my senior year, when I
was attending a ceremony celebrating my induction,
along with thirty other classmates, into Phi Beta
Kappa. This group represented, more or less, the
thirty students with the highest G.P.A.s out of my
class of over a thousand. Accordingly, I had arrived
at the venue prepared to spend the evening with
some serious nerds. As it turns out, however, I was
in for a surprise.

Upon walking through the door that night, I was
immediately struck by how many of the other
students I knew socially. These were people who,
given their level of visibility on campus, I never would
have imagined were scoring straight As. They were
magazine editors, frat boys, and crunchy
environmentalists. I knew them from parties and
campus clubs and through mutual friends. They
were, for the most part, normal, well-rounded, and
interesting—not at all the type of super-grind one
might assume would occupy such an elite level of
academic achievement. The lesson of that night was
obvious: Perhaps I was not, in fact, as unique as I
had first imagined. Maybe there were others out
there who had discovered similar secrets to
academic success.

The writer instincts in me soon took over.
Fascinated to know exactly how these seemingly
normal students had done so well, I sent all of my
fellow Phi Beta Kappas a survey about their study
habits. Most were happy to share their methods and
I quickly confirmed that my suspicions were true. Not
only were many of them using innovative,
homegrown study strategies, but many of these
strategies were surprisingly similar to those that I
had developed during the previous few years.

At the time I had just finished editing the
manuscript for my first book, *How to Win at College*,
so I wasn’t exactly eager to get started right away
with another massive writing project. But after seeing
these initial survey responses, I knew I had stumbled
onto something big. While most college students toil
arduously through the study and paper-writing
processes, there exists an elite group of undergrads
who have discovered unconventional strategies for
earning much higher grades in much less time. I
wanted to share these secrets with other students,
and thus the idea for this book was born. Soon I was
sending out more questionnaires to more straight-A
students at colleges around the country, until I
gathered enough responses, from students with
enough different backgrounds and majors, to distill
the advice presented in this guide.

In the pages that follow, you will discover the
details of these often surprising study strategies. I’ve
included examples and case studies throughout the
book to demonstrate how to apply the advice in
many different real-life academic situations. You will
learn how to:

* Manage your time and deal with the urge to
procrastinate.
* Take targeted notes in class.
* Handle reading assignments and problem
sets with ease.
* Prepare efficiently for exams.
* Master the art of exam-taking.
* Write incisive critical analysis essays.
* Conduct thorough research.
* Write standout term papers.

Remember, this advice comes from real students
and was honed, through trial and error, in real
college classrooms. This distinction is important. It’s
what separates this book from the many existing
study guides that sit next to it on the bookstore shelf.
As mentioned, most study guides are written either
by professors or academic skills experts, many
years separated from their own college experience.
The result is that the authors of these guides are
disconnected from the realities of undergraduate life.

For example, *How to Study*, by college professors
Allan Mundsack, James Deese, and Ellin K. Deese,
suggests that students wake up at 7 A.M . each
morning, go to sleep by 11 P.M . each night, and on
many days schedule only a single hour of
“recreation,” with the rest of the time dedicated to
attending class, eating, or working. One gets the
feeling that these professors haven’t spent much
time socializing with students lately. Even their plan
for Friday—the biggest party night of the week—has
the student working until 10 P.M., taking a one-hour
break, then turning in by eleven.

*Student Success Secrets*, written by Eric Jensen,
a learning expert and professional public speaker,
offers equally out-of-touch suggestions. His tips to
help you remember concepts learned from a reading
assignment include “put it in a picture or poster—use
intense colors,” “act out the material or do a fun role
play in your own room,” or “create or redo a song;
make a rap .” Just try to imagine a sophisticated
liberal arts major attempting to make a rap about her
recent reading assignment concerning post-
structuralist interpretations of pre-Victorian English
literature! (Key question: What word rhymes with
“Foucault”?)

The granddaddy of all unrealistic study guides,
however, just might be What Smart Students Know ,
by Princeton Review cofounder Adam Robinson. In
this best-selling guide, Robinson suggests—and I
swear I am not making this up—that students
approach a reading assignment as a twelve-step
process! That’s right, twelve separate steps. Before
you even crack the actual assignment, Robinson
suggests that you jot down questions about the
importance of the reading and then take notes on
what you know about the topic, what it reminds you
of, and what you want to learn. He then asks you,
among other things, to read the assignment a total of
three separate times, write and then rewrite your
notes, represent the information in picture form,
construct “question charts,” and devise mnemonics
to help you memorize the concepts. Needless to say,
this approach to a simple reading assignment is
humorously unrealistic. I even did a little math. For a
typical college-level liberal arts course, a student
might be assigned an average of two hundred
pages of reading a week. In his book, Robinson
provides a one-page sample reading and describes
twenty-three different questions that students might
ask about it. At this rate of twenty-three questions
per page, spending thirty seconds on each query,
we would end up spending around forty hours a
week (i.e., a full-time job’s worth of time) simply
completing one of the twelve steps on the reading
assignments for just one class. Sounds like a great
plan!

These examples highlight the simple truth that the
advice in most existing study guides—written by
“experts,” not students—is often impractical and time
consuming. *How to Become a Straight-A Student*,
on the other hand, is the first guide based on the
experiences of real college students, and it was
written to provide an alternative to the other titles on
the market. In the pages that follow, you will find
homegrown strategies that are compatible with the
demands of your day-to-day student life. They may
not be as elaborate as the intricate systems devised
by the “experts,” but they’re easy to implement—and
they get the job done. Best of all, when you start
putting these strategies into practice, you will
experience immediate results.

Keep in mind: If you find a piece of advice that
doesn’t quite fit your needs or circumstances, that’s
okay. In fact, you should expect this. Each of the
students I interviewed for this book had his or her
own unique take on the best way to study. Follow
their lead and, when stuck, experiment. Replace
techniques you don’t like with ones that seem better.
If these new techniques work, keep them; if they fail,
replace them with something else. The key to
improving your grades without becoming a grind
cannot be found in any single study habit. It is,
instead, rooted in the big picture decision to reject
rote review once and for all and begin the flexible
search for strategies that work better for you.

Above all, remember that college is a multifaceted
experience, of which grades are just one of many
important pieces. It’s my hope that this book will help
you painlessly conquer this one piece so you can
have more time and energy to explore all of the
others—the friends, the unburdened idealism, the
heroic beer consumption—that make these four
years so rich.
