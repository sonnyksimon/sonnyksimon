## Introduction

This is not your average college study guide. Unlike
the titles next to it on the shelf, none of the advice
presented here was devised by professors or selfproclaimed
academic skills experts. I promise that
you won’t find any mention of the Cornell note-taking
method, mental map diagrams, or any other “optimal
learning technique” crafted in an office or laboratory
— environments far removed from the realities of
typical college life.

**Instead, this book reveals—for the first time—
the study habits used by real straight-A college
students.**
