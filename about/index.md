about me
~~~~~~~~

I'm interested in computer science, math and physics,
although my formal education is in computing and information systems.
                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Before that I took chemistry, computer science, digital media,
physics and pure-mathematics; in order to satisfy an associate
degree in the natural sciences. This was in June, 2016.


Since then I've worked on building web applications. My background
includes (but is not limited to):

    the c, python, and javascript languages,
    the oracle and postgres database systems,
    and the unix environment.


I lived in bangalore [india] upto the august of 2009, when I migrated
to georgetown [guyana] where I've resided since. I haven't visited
anywhere else, other than the airports of few places in between.
