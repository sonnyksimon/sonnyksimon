A (bad) attempt to tell you what I use to get my job done. It's written in second person.

## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Sonny Kothapally](http://sonnyksimon.com). I write stuff, in code for the most part and in prose otherwise. Actually, you can learn a LOT more about me [here](/about).

## What hardware do you use?

I bought a [Lenovo IdeaPad 330](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IdeaPad#IdeaPad_300_Series), the cheapest Lenovo I could find which still had decent build quality. Lenovos seem the best ones to get if you're not going to go for a MacBook. Data is scattered over multiple SD cards and hard drives, with huge overlaps. I like to keep multiple copies just in case something starts failing.

My laptop runs Linux.

My main mobile device is an [Xperia X Compact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Xperia_X_Compact). I use it to keep in touch with friends and family, and listen to [music](http://nirvana.com).

## And what software?

I try to have a limited number of stuff. In the dock, I keep:

1. [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome) (web surfing)
2. [VSCode](http://code.visualstudio.com/) (writing)
3. [Terminal](http://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/)

All my writing is done in Markdown. I'm trying to switch to ReStructuredText or AsciiDoc but for now that's that.

I mainly program in Python. I tend to use PostgreSQL for my database. I do revision management with Git. On my servers, I use GNU screen to manage tasks. My servers also run Linux.
