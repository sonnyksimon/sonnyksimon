## Reading
I seem to spend so much of my time watching television shows lately that I wasn't reading nearly enough books. I suspect I won't make it through but hopefully there's some progress there.

**Noteworthy**: [Perfume](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume_(novel))

**Amusing**: [A Mathematician's Apology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology), [The Prince](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince), [Crito](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crito)

**Feynman**: [ALL OF THESE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman#Popular_works)

**Archaic**: [Nicolai Copernici Torinensis De reuolutionibus orbium coelestium, libri VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus#The_book)

**Random**: [Coiling Dragon](http://coiling-dragon.fandom.com/wiki/Coiling_Dragon_Wiki) by I Eat Tomatoes (我吃西红柿), [I Shall Seal The Heavens](http://i-shall-seal-the-heavens.fandom.com/wiki/Home) by Er Gen (耳根)
